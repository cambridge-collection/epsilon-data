            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's "great curiousity", the primrose carnation. Finds it odd that is has no smell, Mrs Goodenough recalls seeing one at Windsor which was also scentless. Received a specimen of the plant Smith wrote to Mr Weatherhead about but can not recollect what it is called, it was possibly 'Stachys' but can find nothing in Gmelin's "Systema Naturae". [Hugh] Davies and [Edward] Donovan [(1768-1837), zoologist] are still in dispute over fish: Davies' letter appeared in the "Gentleman's Magazine" two months before Donovan's response, the former writes like a Welshman and the latter an artist "who thinks all the world must be as eager as himself to cull some lucky snap which has escaped the eyes of others", discusses the grievances and fears being dragged in on account of his paper on the Porbeagle shark in "Linnean Transactions" which used a drawing of Davies' [see RelatedMaterial]. Asks Smith to look for 'Confervae' in Lowestoft. Political horizon "clouding".</p></abstract>
