            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 16 November 1800. Surprised by Smith's statement that 'Polypodium cambricum' is a variety of 'Polypodium vulgare'. Discussion of flowers of 'Malaxis loeselii' and 'Malaxis [rheedei]' ('Epidendrum resupinatum' Forst.), believes 'Limodorum nutans' Rox. and 'Epidendrum candatum' are of the 'Malaxis' genus. Would like to send Smith his last paper on the 'Orchideous' order. Hopes Smith received the cryptogamous plants he previously sent.</p><p>Discussion of 'Carex': has received several new species of 'Carex' from Lapland. One is from 71 degrees latitude, believes it is the "primitive" 'Carex leporina' of "Flora Lapponica" and has named it 'Carex [lagopodioides]' as they intend the 'leporina' name for the common one or the "ovalis Gooden.". Requests specimens of the 'Carex' from Smith's paper in fifth volume of "Linnean Transactions", except 'Carex tomentosa' [Smith has annotated: "sent binervis, laevigata, fulva &amp; distans"], in addition to 'C. rigida' [ticked by Smith], 'C. pulla', 'C. axillaris' [ticked by Smith], 'C. teretiuscula' [ticked by Smith], 'C. divisa', and 'C. paludosa'. Asks if Smith agrees that the English 'Polypodium ilvense' is quite different from the Linnaean one, which is common in Sweden. Surprised to find that what was labelled a specimen of 'Cypripedium bulbosus' was in fact a true 'Linodori' and not a 'Cymbidium' as he thought. Asks what species of 'Salix' the Huntingdon or Leicester willow is. [Erik] Acharius and [Johan Peter] Westring worthy candidates for Linnean Society. Surprised that CorrÃªa has not heard of his election to the Stockholm Academy of Sciences and fears his letters to him have miscarried. [Adam] Afzelius is well.</p></abstract>
