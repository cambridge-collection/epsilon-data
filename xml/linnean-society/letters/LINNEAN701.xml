            <abstract><p>Reply to Goodenough's letter dated 25 September 1812; will pacify Mr Holme's botanical pride, should it become necessary. Cannot change his name for 'Carex rariflora' as it is already printed in a current book, as well as it being difficult to find new names for so large a genus; Goodenough's suggestion of 'nivalis' is suitable to many exotic ones. [Dawson] Turner busy "being all things to all men &amp; women", and printing a "Lichenographia Britannica" with [William] Borrer.</p><p>Discussion of domestic and international affairs: the new Parliament will not find their business easy; fears Britain will have to give up Spain; Britain making America a maritime power; sees comfort in Russia [Napoleon's failed invasion of Russia]. Received account from [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert and Sir Joseph Banks: Lambert has found 'Carduus tuberosus', it is as obstinate a weed as '[Carduus] arvensis'. Smith intends to follow the the thirty-sixth, and final, volume of "English Botany" with the fourth volume of "Flora Britannica", and has finished the third part of "Florae Graecae Prodromus".</p></abstract>
