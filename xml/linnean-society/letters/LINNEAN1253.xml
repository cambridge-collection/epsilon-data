            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 22 September and basket of plants, they have the 'Corchorus' which is "very beautiful" and thrives well outside. Recently visited Weymouth, [Dorset], where they now intend to annually spend the spring months, the only unpleasant ones at Hafod. Regrets never having accepted [Thomas William] Coke and Smith's invitations to Norfolk. Expects his journeys to London to become less frequent in future.</p><p>Nothing can be done in Parliament, and the "late disgraceful business of the Princess [Charlotte] of Wales [(1796-1817)] has shown all parties in base colours"; thinks it is the fault of the "two great leaders" being taken away, dreads a "general crash".</p><p>Ill-use by his relations has left him anxious to dispose of the reversion of Hafod to some "rich man of taste". He has made so many improvements that Smith would not know the place.</p><p>[Note in pencil states that Johnes was 66 years old on 2 September 1813]</p></abstract>
