            <abstract><p>Insists that he sent a franked letter to Smith after leaving Rochester, it included praise of Smith's "Introduction to Botany" [not extant]. His new duties at the House of Lords more time consuming than he anticipated. Thinks naming plants after unworthy people "lowers the science" [in reference to Richard Salisbury naming 'Hookera' after his botanical artist William Hooker [(1779-1832)]. Sends back Smith's work [for "Flora Graeca"] with queries on Latin usage for several items. Spent the day with [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert who has just received large addition of [New] South Wales plants to his herbarium. Sir Abraham Hume, Admiral and Mrs Essington, General [Francis (c 1758-1814)] and Mrs Grose, [Alexander] Macleay, [Thomas] Marsham, and Lord Seaforth were also there. Wrote to Dawson Turner correcting 'Griffithsii' to 'Griffithsiae'. Persuaded Hume to become a FLS. Shall discuss the new Geological and Entomological societies the next time he sees Smith. Mrs Lynn in decline. Hopes to visit Smith's sister in Liverpool on his way to Carlisle.</p></abstract>
