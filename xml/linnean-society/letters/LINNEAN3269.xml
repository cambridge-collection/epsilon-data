            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 17 and 26 April [1813], hopes Smith received the letter he forwarded from Professor Sprengel at Halle. News of [Erik] Acharius: pleased by his admittance to Linnean Society and is anxious to receive "Linnean Transactions" and his diploma; planning to send further specimens to add to the "the expedition"collection he previously sent; hopes Smith will wait for publication of his "Synopsis methodica Lichenum" before Smith finishes that part of ["English Botany"]. Swedish Academy [of Sciences] agrees to a "transactions" exchange with the Linnean Society. Pleased that the 6 volumes of "Svensk Botany" have arrived. Relieved to to hear of Sir Joseph Banks' recovery as he had previously been told he was already dead. Asks to be remembered to [Robert] Brown, [Dawson] Turner, and [William Jackson] Hooker.</p></abstract>
