            <abstract><p>Pleased his paper on 'Lycoperdon' met with Smith's approval; sent specimens as he is convinced his remarks will stand the test of comparison; asks Smith to correct any errors. Requests copy of "Spicilegium botanicum" for [Robert] Stone [(c 1751-1829), botanist] glad "Icones pictae" has sold so well; eager to see "Linnean Transactions"; last number of "English botany" "excellent", especially the 'Trientalis'.</p><p>Has not yet seen Sir Brooke Boothby's [7th baronet, (1744-1824), poet and writer] response to [Edmund] Burke [(1730-1797), politician] but hopes to have it for his book club; Burke's book was a "perfect meteor which blazed for a moment", surprised people could be so led away by a "parcel of high sounding sentences, which when analysed, appeared to have very little meaning". Hopes Smith finds his 'Lycoperdon' specimen from Edinburgh so his note can continue; issues of addressing Smith in his paper. Wishes Smith and [Samuel] Goodenough would settle whether 'Fucus elongatus' Linnaeus is same as 'F. lorens' Hudson. Thought Smith reviewed [John] Berkenhout's [(1726-1791), physician and naturalist] "Manual" in the "Critical [Review]", as the person knew the Linnaean herbarium.</p></abstract>
