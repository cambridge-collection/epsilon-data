            <abstract><p>Received Smith's parcel as he was leaving for Bulstrode [home of Duke of Portland in Buckinghamshire]. Discussion of 'Carex': has not been able to run through Smith's synonyms; there are two synonyms referred to in [Pier Antonio] Micheli's [(1679-1737)] plate which Goodenough quoted for 'C. rigida'; believes Smith's 'C. binervis' grows near Hastings, Sussex, had always thought it different from 'C. distans'; Smith's 'C. micheliana' "a good species"; asks Smith to rename his 'C. vesicaria' as there are "cogent reasons" for the existing 'C. vesicaria' name; believes Linnaeus' 'C. vesicara' was 'C. sylvatica'. Astonished that [Robert John] Thornton's [(c 1768-1837), physician and writer on botany] work is now printing ["A new illustration of the sexual system of Linnaeus"]. Desperate for Smith's "Flora [Britannica]" to come out; believes under Smith's "correct auspices [botany will] stride on to perfection". Sending Smith's corrected manuscripts to [John] White [publisher] but asks who "Hull." often quoted by Smith is; suggests alternatives for the words "scrotiforme" and "genitalia" to spare Smith's "character for delicacy". Eager for Scottish specimens of Smith's new 'Carex' species, particularly 'Carex incurva'.</p><p>On verso of second folio Goodenough notes that "Enchiridion" would be a good name for Smith's "Epitome" but as there is already a work under that title suggests "Synopsis" instead.</p></abstract>
