            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 28 August. Discussion of several stately homes: enjoyed Smith's account of the Duke of Rutland's old "magnificent" mansion [Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire ?], unsure why noblemen feel it necessary to rebuild such places but concedes that expensive and extravagant houses help the economy; glad to hear Smith speak well of Lord Mountnorris [George Annesley], never understood "how that scoundrel [John Bellenden] Gawler [(1764-1842), soldier] was let into his house" [in 1796 Annesley won damages from Gawler for committing adultery with his wife]. Asks if Smith had to pay 20 shillings for entry to Whiteknights [Berkshire home of George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough]; imagines the 1100 feet long walk of 'Robinia viscosa' must be a wonderful. Shocked by the fall of the once "resplendent" Spencer-Churchills; recalls that his grandfather half ruined himself trying to secure the family and Goodenough thinks the present Duke "below contempt". Glad Smith enjoyed the British portraits in the British gallery. Followed Smith in visiting Claremont [house in Surrey bought for Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold]; Prince Leopold is "so affable, so very civil, so attentative, &amp; withal truly princely".</p><p>Agrees with Smith that Sir Humphry Davy will be chosen as new Royal Society president but doubts it can keep its superior status; believes Sir Joseph Banks was wrong allowing the establishment of the Animal Chemistry Society as now only the chemical and algebraical pursuits are left to it, fears consequences of Davy's wife becoming involved.</p><p>The trial of the Queen [Caroline (1768-1821), wife of George IV]: shocked by the "filthy memoirs" about her which are appearing, thinks bishops should not be allowed at such recitals; the radical papers call her "pure as unsunned snow [and] spotless innocence"; fears it will continue till his return to London; relates a jest by one of the lords who when compelled to take off his hat to the Queen said "hurrah, the Queen for ever, &amp; may all your wives be like her".</p></abstract>
