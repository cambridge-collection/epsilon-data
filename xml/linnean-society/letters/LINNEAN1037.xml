            <abstract><p>Invites Smith to visit her the next time he is in London. Apologises for long delay in correspondence, caused by her "nervous disaffection" and ill health, and had meant to respond to Smith's letter congratulating her on "the blessing of Peace". Sorry to hear Smith's old complaint has returned.</p><p>Proposes that a toast be made to her late husband, [Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd marquess of Rockingham (1730-1782), prime minister], at the Linnean Society Anniversary meeting on 24 May, as his birthday was also 24 May and he was a "rising botanist of great promise" and "a most attach'd disciple of Linnaeus". Thanks for present of dried fruit and biscuits, which have now regained their "peculiar taste &amp; good quality" following "those cruel times of real, or pretended scarcity", though does not believe that any flour have yet or perhaps ever will return to same quality as before. Praises the sermon Smith sent her, which reminds her of something in [James] Saurin [(1677-1730), French preacher]; details of a sermon she will send in return. Apologises for legibility of letter as her eyelid complaint has returned.</p></abstract>
