            <abstract><p>Account of recent travels: visited May Island in the Firth of Forth and Bell Rock Lighthouse [built 1807-1810], "our Scottish Eddystone" [Eddystone Lighthouse, off coast of Devon], and a botanical excursion in Perthshire with James Brown who showed him 'Linnaea borealis'. Observations on specimens of heather sent to Smith, asks if one is 'Andromeda coerulea'. Received 'Epimedium alpinum' from Inverness with "mica about the roots", proof that it is indigenous.</p><p>Account of a tour of the Hebrides last summer: sailed round the north of Scotland to the Giants Causeway in Ireland in a month with Dr Barlcay, Mr Oliphant, and [Robert] Stevenson [(1772-1850)], engineer of Bell Rock lighthouse. Encountered nothing notable except in mineralogy, plants included: 'Sison verticillatum', 'Hypericum androsaemum', 'Cotyledon umbilicus', and 'Lythrum salicaria'. Observations on rocks, a bay in Antrim superior to Giants Causeway, the rocks hung with 'Asplenium marinum'. Lewis Isles "sterility itself". A bed of 'Serpentine' on Glass Island, the lighthouse keeper aware of excellency of 'Agrostis alba' as winter feed for his cow but unaware of fiorin grass. Saw Macalister's Cave in Skye with 'Rhodelia rosea' and 'Scolopendrum vulgare' and pretty but "ungrand "stalactites. At Orkney [William Jackson] Hooker and [William] Borrer were asked after by the inhabitants. At Aberdeen intended to see [James] Beattie but arrived just in time for his funeral.</p><p>Mr Macnab from Kew "doing wonders" at Edinburgh Botanic Garden but frustrated by lack of funds, the 'Dracaena draco' is to cut over in the autumn unless £40-£50 is found to raise its glass roof so it can survive the winter, wishes the Prince Regent was aware of the situation.</p></abstract>
