            <abstract><p>Sending parcel of one hundred and thirty plants for Smith via Mr Gooch, some of which are from Smith's desiderata, and with this letter includes systematic list of them [extant]. Explains key to his list: plants marked with a red cross urgently need an answer from Smith; plants marked "S" are gathered in Switzerland and "G" from his garden. Smith has further annotated Davall's systematic list of specimens, marking "Fl" on those incorporated into his herbarium and a series of ticks denoting when he wrote his remarks on the specimens.</p><p>Also sends six drawings of his work for [James] Sowerby with the original specimens, and two samples of beadwork from a convent for Smith's sister. 'Smithia sensitivia' and 'Diapensia lapponica' framed and glazed in his study. Requests another copy of "Hortus Kewensis" as the "Flemish affairs" prevent communications between Switzerland and England.</p></abstract>
