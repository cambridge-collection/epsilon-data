            <abstract><p>Pleased to hear that Smith is in London and intends to visit him in Rochester; describes the comforts of his house and limitations of Rochester society, "we are all military, mercantile in a little way, or artificers". Has exchanged his living of Copredy, Oxfordshire, for the nearby Boxley, Kent. Received Smith's letters of 1 and 6 May. Asks Smith to defer his business to next week and stay with him this week; the journey from Charing Cross is only five hours. Intending to come up to London himself on 20 May. Has seen that Miss Mary Aynscombe has married Mr Mossop and settled eight miles from Boxley; recalls Smith once saying she was a "great botanist". Intends to attend Linnean Society anniversary meeting on 24 May after missing the last few.</p></abstract>
