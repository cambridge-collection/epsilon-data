            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 2 [July]. In great distress about his regiment: received letter from his Lieutenant-Colonel that out of 960 men only 300 would embark [for Ireland] and that out of the rest 200 mutinied on the march to Ormskirk, [Lancashire], at which point General Grinfield and garrison marched against them; many were in irons and tried by court martial but as yet does not know the result. Bad weather prevented several transports from making the crossing, and now after having commanded the regiment for 20 years must leave it disgraced, and blames vanity of Mr Ravenscroft for debacle for never sending him the proposal to go to Ireland to forward to the Duke [of York]. Confusion remains over whether the regiment will go or not.</p><p>Dr [David] Davies came last night; he thinks she [his daughter, Mariamne Johnes] is not worse. Recommends Smith read [Horatio] Walpole's [4th Earl of Orford (1717-1797)] correspondence.</p></abstract>
