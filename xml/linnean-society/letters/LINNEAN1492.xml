            <abstract><p>Smith's busyness; glad their acquaintance commenced before Smith acquired "the greatest treasure England can boast". Lets Smith decide which genus to rename 'Woodwardia', hopes a 'Dicksonia' will accompany that and 'Davallia'. Anticipating Smith's "Flora Lapponica" and "Icones [pictae]", [James] Dickson's "Fasc[iculus plantarum cryptogamicarum Britanniae]", and [Johann] Schreber's [(1739-1810)] "Genera plantarum". Reports greatly exaggerated of his suffering a severe attack of his disorder shortly after Smith left Norfolk; his symptoms. Hopes [William] Withering is elected to Linnean Society; he and Professor [Thomas] Martyn nominate [Revd Thomas] Zouch, minister of the late Mr Tunstall's parish and highly esteemed by him, and [Revd Charles] Favell; Favell found 'Anagallis foemina' in his parish, will send specimens for [James] Sowerby if desired.</p><p>Glad Smith enjoyed the game he sent from [Andrew] Fountaine's, though he has given up shooting; will also send a turkey so Smith can wish them many happy Christmases and prosperous New Years, though it is "out of fashion now". [John] Pitchford has corresponded with [William] Sole on mints, from his letters he seems a "very queer genius"; Sole angry with Smith for having spoken "so slightingly" of [John] Hill's [(1716-1775), botanist] "Vegetable System". Eager to see a good figure of 'Ligusticum cornubiense'.</p></abstract>
