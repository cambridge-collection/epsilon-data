            <abstract><p>Sends book for Dr Forster. Thanks for his father's advice about Frogmore and will not make use of the invitation [to teach the Queen and Princesses botany]. Sends receipts for his father's, Francis', and John's Sierra Leone shares. His father's ticket won Â£20. His brother Richard applied to [Robert] Batty [(1763-1849), apothecary] for 3 guineas whilst he was out, has since given instruction not to lend him any money. Account of his lectures: 17 pupils, of which 15 pay, but no ladies; hopeful of their "gaining ground". [Jonas] Dryander thinks it a good thing the King of Sweden has died. Lady [Amelia] Hume warns that the French refugees about Richmond, [Surrey], risk losing compassion of the public by their "rejoicing at Tippoo Saib's escape or victory" [Tipu Sultan (1750-1799), King of Mysore 1782-1799, in conflict with British forces at this time]. Sends "English botany" and pamphlet on French agriculture in their present "dreadful state".</p></abstract>
