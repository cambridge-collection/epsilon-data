            <abstract><p>Sends letter via Dr [William Jackson] and Mrs Hooker. Thanks for Smith's letter of 28 January; sorry to hear of death of his "excellent nephew" in India and comments on the "numerous instances" of similar losses of "our young &amp; adventurous friends in the Western world".</p><p>Overwhelmed by the literary work he has undertaken, even though he has almost finished work on [Alexander] Pope [(1688-1744), poet] and the third part on "penal jurisprudence". Third and fourth parts of his "Monandrian Plants" about to appear; notes on 'Maranta', 'Phrynium', and 'Thalia', settled by communications from West Indies; 'Myrosma' cultivated abundantly in Martinique and they expect it at [Liverpool] Botanic Garden, worries it might be a 'Phrynium'; an 'Alpinia auriculata' appearing in his next number, along with figure of [Robert] Brown's 'Hellenia cerulea'. Thanks for Smith's good wishes respecting his son, Thomas, who has settled indepently with his "little family" in Camden Town.</p><p>[Letter possibly incomplete: no signature or valediction]</p></abstract>
