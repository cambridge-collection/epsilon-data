            <abstract><p>Only recently received Yates' letter of 10 March [1824]; his ill health last summer and almost total interruption of his literary labours and correspondence have kept him in state of estrangement from many friends, and now he is recovered his work on "English Flora" takes all his time, he "cannot write books and letters too". Explains delay in receiving Yates' letter, caused by it getting caught up in his niece Martin's "drapery". Recollections of Yates' new area of residence in Birmingham.</p><p>His illness prevented him from going to London at all in 1824, having never missed a year before. Intends to go to London in April this year, hopes to see Yates' and Mrs James Yates there. Approves of [William] Roscoe's work [see RelatedMaterial below], hopes he can go on with it. Asks after his Birmingham friends the Corries and Dr Johnstone.</p></abstract>
