            <abstract><p>Apologises for involving Smith in the misunderstandings over appointing a new Linnean Society Secretary; [James] Bicheno was surprised to hear he had apparently refused the position. Objects to [Edward] Barnard on the grounds that he is too close to [Joseph] Sabine, and if made Secretary he would act as [Alexander] Macleay did by being President in all but name. Goodenough objects to Sabine, his habit of provoking disorder in any Society he joins, as at the Athenaeum, and his ordering a committee to discuss a portrait of Macleay when he had no authority to do so. Had hoped for a Secretary no one objected to to be appointed. Believes Sabine is now the effectual manager of the Linnean Society which many will find unpalatable.</p></abstract>
