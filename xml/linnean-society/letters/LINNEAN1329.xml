            <abstract><p>Sends Roscoe a budget about the "plantae scitamineae" and Lord Valentia's [George Annesley] "Indexes to Willdenow" as completed. Describes his his return journey from Liverpool to Norwich via Huntingdon, Cambridge, including the botanic garden, and Ely, including the cathedral.</p><p>Transcribes an attack made by [Richard] Salisbury on himself in fifth number of his "Paradisus Londinensis"; defends himself and transcribes the passage from "Exotic botany" which apparently provoked Salisbury, and details involvement of [Edward] Rudge and [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert. Salisbury also "sneered" at [Ã‰tienne Pierre] Ventenat's "Jardin de la Malmaison", confirming his suspicions of Salisbury's deceit, though if nothing else occurs still intends to reappoint him vice-president of the Linnean Society next year as he has "always been attentive &amp; useful".</p><p>Sends Roscoe his paper on Norwich botanists, and two pods of vanilla from his journey to Italy. Convinced Raphael's picture of the Holy Family at Okeover [Hall, Staffordshire] is an original; description. "Exotic botany" reviewed much more favourably than Roscoe's "Leo" in Baldwin's "Literary Journal". Colonel [Thomas] Hardwicke to visit. The "Monthly Review" speaks "very differently" of his biographical paper, from Salisbury's account in "Annals [of Botany]". Reminds Roscoe of his "purposed assistance" with "Exotic Botany".</p></abstract>
