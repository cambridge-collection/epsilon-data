            <abstract><p>In Exmouth on account of his daughter; she has been unwell for months and recently more so though believes her lungs are not affected and that the disorder is nervous. His sister has received great benefit from taking foxglove under Dr Moncrieffe though just received letter that a fresh tubercule is inflaming. Beddoes currently has five ladies under his care, each in a hammock in a close room with an Alderney cow.</p><p>Will send any marine plants he finds to [James] Sowerby though presently none are washed up and the rocks are barren except for 'Fucus vesiculorus' and 'Ulva compressa', 'Rubia' on cliffs, and '[Calystegia] soldanella', 'Crygium campestre', 'Cuphorbia' and he supposes [William] Hudson's 'Ononis repens' on sand banks between cliffs and beach. Complains that having expected to live on John Dory can get nothing but small whitings and herrings every two or three days.</p></abstract>
