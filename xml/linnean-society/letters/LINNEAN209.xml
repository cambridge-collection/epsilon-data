            <abstract><p>Received Macleay's letter of 22 January [1823], pleased to hear of Miss Macleay's recovery. If the Linnean Society cannot afford to publish "Linnean Transactions" then they ought to either refrain, publish on some other plan, or sell their stock at a cheap rate to booksellers abroad or at home. [Francis] Hamilton's papers on "Hortus Malabaricus" are "extremely valuable to real botanists", but if they extend too far they must be delayed, anxious not to "disgust" Hamilton. The "Horticultural Society Transactions" "form a valuable mass of inform[atio]n &amp; entertainment".</p><p>As Macleay has said nothing of his successor [as Society Secretary] hopes this means he is relenting in his intention to resign. Believes a voluntary contribution to the Society [to improve funds] would be "nominal" and feels it is his duty to "resist for others". Thanks Macleay for hint respecting Master of Westminster's [Edmund Goodenough [(1785-1845)] copy of "Flora Britannica" but finds his "own materials &amp; observations best - do not think me a growing a coxcomb for this". Has finished one volume [of "English flora"] and hopes to have another finished by the time he comes to London.</p></abstract>
