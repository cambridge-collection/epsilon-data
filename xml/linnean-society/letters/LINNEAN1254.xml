            <abstract><p>Anxious for Smith's success at Cambridge [candidature for Botany Professorship] and regrets inability to assist. Thinks it "very handsome" of the Duke of Gloucester [Prince William Frederick (1776-1834), chancellor of Cambridge University] to remain neutral, he is the only member of the royal family he feels attached to. His mother recently died, though she had long been lost to him through the "machinations &amp; lies of others", and only found out accidently through an acquaintance, and not his family. Offers to try and acquire Welsh votes for Smith.</p><p>Does not think any minister will "dare to continue a war in support of the Bourbons", otherwise fears war at home, and comments on what a fall Napoleon has had. Thinks that Napoleon's brother Lucien "has chosen a wider plan"; hears great things of his poem "Charlemagne" and a female acquaintance of his is translating it into English. They had a wet autumn but now frost setting in.</p></abstract>
