            <abstract><p>Happy to hear Smith is on the way to visit Rose Castle, sends his compliments and extends invitation to [Thomas William] Coke and reminisces about when they attended the late Lord Rockingham's levees together [Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham (1730-1782), prime minister 1765-1766 and 1782]. Forwarded Smith's letter to Mr Napier.</p><p>Informed by Mrs Corfield that [Thomas] Marsham is dangerously ill, and what he thought was a recurrance of his asthma is in fact dropsy. Goodenough fears that the letter and insect 'Hippobosca' he sent, from an owl, that differs from the 'Hippobosca avicularis' will distress Marsham's feelings. Alarmed by Smith's comment on how easily Napoleon could be smuggled out of St Helena and astonished by the actions of the new French government, "they are reconcilable to no principle of soverignity, despotism, humanity or prudence". Uneasy that he has only heard from his son, Edmund, once, since he went to Paris.</p></abstract>
