            <abstract><p>Impossible to find one single person to fill all the roles [Jonas] Dryander performed, especially someone with knowledge of all Sir Joseph Banks' collections. Proposes [Thomas] Marsham as Dryander's replacement for vice-president of the Linnean Society, citing example of the Royal Society Treasurer who is always a vice-president. Thinks Smith's choice of [John] Symmons unsuitable as he has discontinued his attendance at the Linnean Society for years and no longer has a strong interest in natural history. Believes Marsham expects to be appointed.</p><p>Resolved a dispute between [William Elford] Leach and [William] Bullock [(fl 1790s-1840s)] at the Linnean Society, in part by giving a sketch of the origin of the Society, owing its stability to "never admitting society hunters, but only practical men who would have an interest in its welfare". One party wanted to propose a vote of censure and put it to the ballot on the same night, "quite illegal". The matter was settled after Leach wrote a letter of apology.</p></abstract>
