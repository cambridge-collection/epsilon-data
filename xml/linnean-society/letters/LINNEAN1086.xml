            <abstract><p>Congratulates Smith on his knighthood, which his "state of long rustication" had left him ignorant of. Does not agree with rewarding men for personal achievements with hereditary baronetcies, which "should evidently exclude a Richmond Apothecary, &amp; many others". Conveyed [Alexander] Macleay's letter on [William] Travis' [(1771-1851)] case [request to be readmitted to Linnean Society] directly to him to prevent further doubts, having already told him that from the circumstances he had no chance. Questioned his son on his marriage intentions following a letter from Smith.</p><p>Does not know 'Chrysanthemum indium'. [James] Lee did not sent the mulberries he requested for pots, he had two on a south wall which bore nothing. His Ribston and Newtown pippins keeping well, as well as his Carlisle codlings raised from cuttings there is no better baking apple.</p><p>Complains that a shooting pony he originally paid £10 for has so far cost about £100 in taxes, with an additional £40 should it live another four years.</p></abstract>
