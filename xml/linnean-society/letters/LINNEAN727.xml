            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's reply; recalls being given specimen of 'Oenothera purpurea' soon after its first introduction, and not having the new edition of "Hortus Kewensis" was unable to make out 'Chrysanthemum carinatum' but now uncertain whether it and 'Anthemis mixta' are not the same.</p><p>Sir Joseph Banks ill with gout but being treated with Sir [Everard] Home's [(1756-1832)] improved medicine, which anyone may now safely take [presumably Colchicum autumnale]. Lady Banks invited Goodenough to look over [Sarah Sophia] Banks' [(1744-1818)] antiquarian collections for disposal. Goodenough believes the King [George III (1738-1820)] is unaware of the Queen's death [Charlotte (1744-1818)].</p><p>[John] Barrow [(1764-1848), promoter of exploration] indignant that the captains of the ships of the polar expedition [to find the North West Passage] turned back just as they were about to make the discoveries for which they were sent out. [Edward] Rudge's candidate at Evesham, Worcestershire, came off "with flying colours", comments on hostility now existing between Rudge and Lord Northwick [John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick (1770-1859)]. Goodenough thinks he has a specimen of 'Dianthus arenarius' at Rose Castle. [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert completely absorbed by botany and does not mention anything of the failure of his brother-in-law, Mr Benett, in the election.</p></abstract>
