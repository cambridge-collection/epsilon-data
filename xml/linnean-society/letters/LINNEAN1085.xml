            <abstract><p>The moors so wet this season that riding is impossible and game is scarcer. Encloses undisclosed package. Mr Peirson an unambitious man who will be gratified by Smith's insertion of any two of his habitats; his qualities. His sister's illness: since marrying at 18 she has had 11 children, is now 39 and breeding and anxious attendance of children have worn her out; Dr Fraser diagnosed tubercules on her lungs, she came to Bristol after lowering plan, hemlock and herbane failed; Dr Moncrieffe confirmed Fraser's opinion and at first gave fruit and cooling diet alone and since then foxglove; in letter of 12th her pulse varies but is sometimes 100 and when the fever is on her cough abates and vice versa, complains of difficulty of access to the wells from Clifton, a great evil considering bad season in which he does not see fruit or corn ripening.</p></abstract>
