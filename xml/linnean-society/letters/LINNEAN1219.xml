            <abstract><p>Rages at ingratitude he has met with [no details of incident are provided]: wishes Smith would create a work on the plan of Baron Borne's "Monochologia" and call it "Causidicologica", from the "lowest blotter of paper to the director of a Royal Conscience", and would give Smith all the necessary assistance needed. Best accounts of his daughter's [Mariamne Johnes] health: thanks to [Thomas] Beddoes [(1760-1808), chemist and physician] living in "such a consumptive latitude" he "sees it in all shapes" so they were alarmed in time and by following his advice she has recovered. Does not think she had any pulmonary disease but it might have developed, they went to Clifton [near Bristol] for treatment.</p><p>Thanks Smith for what he says of the naked barley but [Thomas William] Coke told him it was very unproductive. Asks if Smith knows of an American wheat which is six weeks earlier than the common sort, informed of by Mr Galton. His farm and garden doing "vastly well", especially the dairy, and next year intends to have 50 to 60 cows. His family rejoice at Weston's good fortune.</p></abstract>
