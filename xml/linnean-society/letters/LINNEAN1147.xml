            <abstract><p>Will of Thomas Johnes: estimated that after debts Thomas Johnes has left his widow [Jane Johnes] £40,000, "much more than sufficient" for a comfortable maintenance. A considerable legacy was left to Hugh Smith, late of Lincoln's Inn, and the reversion of Hafod, [Cardiganshire], was sold to Clauton two years ago, to be completed on Johnes' death.</p><p>Fruit experiments: after experimenting with white chili and black strawberry varieties to find specific identity is now convinced they are both varieties of the Canadian wood strawberry, culled by gardeners of the Duke of Kent [Prince Edward (1767-1820)], which is the parent of the common. Bred peach and almond freely so no longer doubts their specific identity and hopes to present fruit obtained from seed of almond and pollen of peach to the Linnean Society next year.</p><p>Attended Linnean Society anniversary meeting; there was general sorrow at Smith's absence and the cause of it, hopes he is well again. Happy to observe the increase of "friendly feelings" between the Linnean and Horticultural Societies, and the latter as the younger Society is careful not to invade on the Linnean's province. Received letter from [Charles-François Brisseau de] Mirbel; he has given Horticultural Society his hypothesis on the conversion of bark into albumum. Unsure of what to make of his "rival" Patrick Keith [(1769-1840), clergyman and botanist] in "Linnean Transactions" and two subsequent volumes [see RelatedMaterial below], as his "misrepresentations are too gross"; will ignore the books but must point out his "Transactions" errors.</p></abstract>
