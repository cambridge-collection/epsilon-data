            <abstract><p>Keeping Woodward's specimens of 'Ulva atomaria' and 'U. ligulata' to finish their descriptions, but not publishing them in "English botany" before "Linnean Transactions", 'U. diaphara' appearing in July. Returns Woodward's 'Chrysanthum', thinks it 'C. inodorom'. Received wild Hampshire 'Tamarix gallica' from Maton. Changes made to Woodward's 'Ulva' paper. Breakfasted with [John] Stackhouse yesterday; discusses Stackhouse's and [Thomas] Velley's quarrel over fructification of 'Fucus', thinks Stackhouse "most in the right"; his general dislike of disputes; he and Stackhouse have agreed to call 'Ulva/Fucus punctatus' 'Fucus maculatus'.</p><p>[David Elisha] Davy's "metamorphosis" into an "unfrocked state". Received another visit from Stackhouse, who is like Woodward in "face &amp; speech", but taller, desiring him not to get involved in his dispute with Velley; his relief, as Velley is an "endless talker". Intends to leave for [Thomas] Johnes' in Wales morning after Linnean Society anniversary meeting.</p><p>Has amongst his Scotch plants a perforated 'Ulva', near 'Agarum'. Goodenough's and his paper on Fucus' will be read on 2 June. Has nearly engaged a house opposite Lee's garden in Hammersmith, [Middlesex], and the Society are also taking a house and employing a clerk. He has "many weighty matters" on his mind but "remarkably well, &amp; too much occupied to be melancholy". Intends to publish new genus 'Boronia' in next number of "[Botany of] New Holland" [in honour of Fran√ßois Borone].</p></abstract>
