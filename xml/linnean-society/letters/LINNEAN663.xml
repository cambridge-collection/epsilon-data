            <abstract><p>Forwarded Smith's letter to George Don and [Pleasance] Smith's letter to Miss Casmajor. Informs Pleasance Smith he has read and profited from [John] Gay's [(1685-1732), poet and dramatist] "Fables". Hopes Smith fulfills his pledge of publishing fourth volume of "Flora Britannica" this spring. 'Hieracium murorum' growing in garden walls of Rose Castle, fears this information will be too late for Smith to publish and suggests including in Smith's next publication of Don's species. Cold weather has made his gout linger. An angry debate is coming up in Parliament; weary of party politics but this is preferable to Lord Grenville [William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville (1759-1834), prime minister 1806-1807] coming in with the "hungry, unprincipled fellows that must come in with him, both in Church &amp; State". Pities Napoleon's new Austrian wife [Marie Louise of Austria (1791-1847), married 11 March 1810], "she is a good figure, it is said, &amp; a fine shape, but her face is not handsome - rather short &amp; wide" and fears for her happiness should she be infertile.</p></abstract>
