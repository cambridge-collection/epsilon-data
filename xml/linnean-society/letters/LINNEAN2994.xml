            <abstract><p>Complains about his publisher White who has not sent out books as promised and made imperfect copies of Lambert's book. Complains about an individual [possibly Richard Salisbury] who borrowed Lambert's copy of [Charles] Konig's work on ferns and made notes in the book. After discussion with [Robert] Brown also observed that this individual did the same in Sir Joseph Banks' copy of Smith's "Introduction" in reference to "Menzies plant", a dispute over how he obtained his information. Lord Valentia [George Annesley] has just had a "dreadful operation", the first sheet of his "'Travels" has just been printed, intends addressing Salisbury severely in the first volume over his "very indecent paper". Has just written an account of his own herbarium for possible publication.</p></abstract>
