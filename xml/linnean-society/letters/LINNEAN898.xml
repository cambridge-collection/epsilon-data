            <abstract><p>Asks after Smith's recent movements and activities, including "Flora Britannica". A mild winter allowed him to gather flowering 'Vinca minor' three miles from Bury. Sends his respects to Dr [George] Shaw and [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert. Asks if Smith has heard from [Richard] Relhan, whose affairs are "deranged" in spite of a Â£700 subscription. Asks if new editions of [William] Withering's "Botanical Arrangement" and "Hortus Kewensis" are to appear. Will pay his lapsed Linnean Society subscription before next anniversary meeting. Asks for a copy of Sir George Staunton's "Embassy to China" to be reserved for him at White's; missed the first edition of [James] Cook's last voyage through failing to do this. A spare room always available at his house for friends.</p><p>Addition at head of recto of first folio states he fears a letter to [James] Sowerby requesting all previous numbers of his "Cryptogamia" has been lost.</p></abstract>
