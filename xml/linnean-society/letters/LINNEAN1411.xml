            <abstract><p>Thanks for Roscoe's letter of 8 April, parcel of [Charles] Plumier [(1646-1704) botanist] drawings and book for Lady [Pleasance] Smith. Staying at his cousins the Kindersleys house; his wife at Lowestoft caring for her invalid parents._x000D_</p><p>With [Thomas William] Coke saw a picture of Napoleon being crowned king of Italy, painted at Milan, being sold for Â£1500. Details his and Coke's plans for their Lancashire visit and possibly Hafod, [Cardiganshire, home of Thomas Johnes]; invites Roscoe to join them. No comment on public affairs as it is all in the papers, excepting that there "still seems a backwardness for war". He is halfway through his lectures, which are well attended by a "very elegant &amp; fashionable audience". Deaths of Dr [Joseph] Brandreth [(1746-1815), physician], and one of Mrs Reeve's sons. His mother thinking of travelling to Liverpool. Pleased that Roscoe is binding some of Coke's manuscripts. Received great encouragement from Bishop of Bristol [William Mansel] regarding Cambridge [his candidature for botany professorship].</p></abstract>
