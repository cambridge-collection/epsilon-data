            <abstract><p>Staying with [Edmund] Davall in Orbe, gives a detailed account of Davall's current condition and its history. Believes Davall's condition to be more epilepsy than paralysis and to have had its immediate cause in overwork and overeating from the delusion that he was threatened with a consumption. Detailed description of Davall's fits, has been prescribed powder of valerian root with a little musk to be taken 3 or 4 times a day, has also been treated with "calomil bark" and "flores zinci". Davall experienced much uneasiness having only heard rumours circulated by the French as to the condition of England, has been relieved to hear of the efforts of English resistance. Believes Davall will recover. Comments on the beauty of the area around Orbe. Hopes to send a work by Linnaeus he found in Bern, Switzerland.</p></abstract>
