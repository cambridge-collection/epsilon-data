            <abstract><p>Pleasance's "long bullace" curious, though the specimens now too dry to examine. Attended the theatre to see Miss O'Neil as Juliet [in "Romeo and Juliet"]; "not extravagantly delighted". His last lecture was on 14 June with plants from Kew, seemed well liked. Dined with Richard Kindersley [Smith's cousin] at Mrs Wiggin's, delighted with Miss Nicolay's singing; dined at C Scott's. Pleasance's writing box in "great honour, &amp; much admired". Dined with the Hudson Gurneys, Mr and Mrs Hanbury alone; Jemima Kindersley [Smith's cousin]; saw Richard Westall [(1765-1836), painter], whose property all to be sold; dined at Mr Stracey's; Dr [Martin] Davy of Caius [College, Cambridge], who is interesting the Duke of Gloucester [Prince William (1776-1834), chancellor of Cambridge University] in his Cambridge concerns; attended Stephen Weston's "long promised" lecture on Chinese porcelain. His mother has departed for Liverpool, [Lancashire]. He has heard too many new waltzes to decide which to dance with Pleasance's mother._x000D_</p><p>Anxiety about politics; the engagement they had [Battle of Waterloo, 18 June 1815] a "serious one" and it is in vain the ministerial papers "make a triumph of it"; [Alexander] Macleay says the Belgian troops ran away. Plans for his return to Norwich, [Norfolk].</p></abstract>
