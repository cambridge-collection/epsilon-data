            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 12 April [1807]. Currently unable to add to his collection of botanical drawings and has instead been collecting insects. Sorry Smith's "Exotic botany" has not been successful. Laments the loss of his valuable books, papers, and drawings, including of insects, in sinking of the ship "Lady Burgess". Left his collection of bird drawings with a brother at Wisbech, [Cambridgeshire], but laments not showing them to [John] Latham and fears other collectors will discover and publish them in during his absence from England. No longer certain how long he will stay in India following the death of his sister.</p><p>Glad that [Francis] Buchanan left his dried plants and drawings with Smith rather than Mr L [Lambert?]; he departed for his statistical mission a month ago; his advantages in being supported by government. Concerned that Sir Joseph Banks will suffer more with gout every returning winter. Long suspected [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert's indisposition. Directions for sending "Linnean Transactions" and other works during his absence, including Smith's "Physiological &amp; Systematical Botany". Asks that he be sent one of [James] Sowerby's "portable cabinets of minerals". [William] Roxburgh's work.</p><p>Has found that the plant which produces Columba root is a species of 'Menispermum', as he always predicted. Asks to be remembered to [Thomas] Marsham, [Edward] Rudge, Sir Thomas Cullum, and [Alexander] Macleay. Sent a packet of seeds for [Thomas] Johnes and Marquis of Blandford [George Spencer-Churchill]</p></abstract>
