            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 1 February 1797. Sending specimens of 'Jonesia asoca', 'Flemingia grandiflora', and 'Thunbergia fragrans', the only species he knows of in India, for Smith's observations, includes some of his own. Duplicates from a box of specimens sent to Sir Joseph Banks for [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert should be given to Smith. Started despatching generic and specific characters of his plant drawings two years ago after hearing they were to be published, the twelfth hundred are now ready. Separately sending seeds of his 'Grislea tomentosa', formerley 'Lythrum', glad to hear that it is growing in Edinburgh Botanic Garden, has had no acknowledgment of the seeds and plants he has sent there since the death of [John] Hope, asked Banks to name one of the new genera after Hope if the former 'Hopea' proves to be a 'Lymplocos'. Assumes Smith has received 'Dillenia indica' flowers. An "infinite" amount of insects in his location but only just started collecting them on Smith's request, separately sending four of a cloud of locust and the letter sent from the surgeon who sent them to Roxburgh. Intends to go to Cape [of Good Hope] for his health.</p></abstract>
