            <abstract><p>Apologises for delay in forwarding letters to Smith; took the necessary measures for obtaining box sent from America; confirms [William] Swainson's Sicilian 'Orchideae' were sent to Mr Anderson at Chelsea. [John Russell, 6th] Duke of Bedford elected FLS at last Linnean Society meeting. "Linnean Transactions" printed, [Samuel Latham] Mitchill's paper on American fish was not included. Asks Smith's opinion of [John] Murray of Stranraer, [Scotland], and suitability to become FLS. Was unable to meet Smith's acquaintance, Dr Burke, at the Transport Office.</p><p>[Thomas] Marsham's affairs are in "a sad state"; read a letter from him at Council declaring his present inability to repay any of the £400 he owes the Society, but he hopes to pay it to his successor as Treasurer soon; the Society is to sell £400 of stock so as to be able to pay [James] Sowerby. Smith is named "Institutor and President of the Society" in published Society minutes.</p><p>Asks after Smith's "Cambridge business" [campaign for botany professorship]; was surprised to hear of Smith's new opponent, [William] Kirby, but confident he will not do anything unhandsome towards Smith. Asks if it is true that Miss Fanny Smith is to be married to his friend, the second son of [James Sinclair, 12th] Earl of Caithness [(1766-1823)]. Thanks for turkey.</p></abstract>
