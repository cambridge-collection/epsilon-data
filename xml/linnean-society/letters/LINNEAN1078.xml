            <abstract><p>He and Mr [Hugh] Davies identify same plant for [William] Hudson's 'C. nigra'. Has not heard of Mr Di in London. Smith's 'Glaucium fulvum' still in flower and some plants from last year's seed have yellow petals, it is a very hardy plant easily raised and transplanted, "a very desireable acquisition". Last autumn received seeds of a "green fleshed melon from Egypt" from Archbishop of York [Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt (1757-1847)] but it has not successfully cropped yet, though at Bishopthorpe [Palace, near York,]"they are considered as superior to all others" with a very rind thin and a green coloured transparent flesh, bears no comparison to the orange cantalope. Received 'Nuphar minima' seeds from [James] Brodie which he will sow "properly sunk, in some pool".</p><p>Suffered more "perspirations and fatigue" this shooting season than in any other. Sir Stephen [8th Baronet (1780-1815)] and Lady [Mary] Glynne visited recently. His brother quartered at Brighton, [Sussex]. Received haunch of buck venison from [Alexander Gordon, 4th] Duke of Gordon [(1743-1827)], his stag venison not good but [John Murray, 4th] Duke of Atholl's [(1755-1830)] "said to be often excellent".</p></abstract>
