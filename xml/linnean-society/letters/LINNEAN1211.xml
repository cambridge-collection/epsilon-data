            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's last two letters and the seeds. Thanks Smith's brother for the fearnoughts [thick woolen overcoats] which are "very acceptable for our poor"'; requests annual supply. All improving with him and his family: his daughter's [Mariamne Johnes] health better daily, as well as her wisdom, status and beauty; his wife recovering quickly from a very severe cold; his own health the best for ages, which he attributes to the wines from Smith's friend, Voght; his farm "answering amazingly"; all his sales have been successful; and if he gets his asking price for an estate he is selling he will be "clear", after which he can concentrate on translating Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler].</p><p>Believes that Lloyd, a "dirty dog of a parson" with a curacy in Norfolk, started the rumour that he was to sell Hafod to Mr Crowe.</p></abstract>
