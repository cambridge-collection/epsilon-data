            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's two letters; his alarm was less by the time the first arrived and his daughter [Mariamne Johnes] has recovered quickly; [Thomas] Beddoes [(1760-1808), chemist and physician] was right in speaking out his mind and now rises in his opinion, and Mariamne is now happier than she has been in last six months. Beddoes prescribed her small doses of the 'Calx muricata' and a drop of muriatic acid twice a day, which works "wonderfully well"; she has no phlegm or cough though at one point Beddoes feared tuberculosis; her activities. Delighted with Bristol and its environs, "the air &amp; water have a peculiar softness". Asks [Thomas] Marsham to send sixth volume of "Linnean Transactions".</p></abstract>
