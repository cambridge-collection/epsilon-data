            <abstract><p>Sent a barrel of oysters for Smith. [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert in high spirits but Mrs [Catherine] Lambert worse than ever and never sees anyone. Smith's distinction between 'Geum' and 'Dryas' "very satisfactory" and Goodenough had not observed it before; singular generic character of 'Icosandria' so striking it makes one examine the plants carelessly.</p><p>They had a wintry summer and kept fires in all rooms as in the depth of winter, and garden produce was badly damaged: no apples, unripe pears, flavourless strawberries and raspberries, and corn very late and still green in fields on 3 November, but they produced mulberries only the third time and enjoyed a good peach harvest at the end of October. Less radicalism in his area of Cumberland. Comments on the difficulty of filling the positions of Attorney and Solicitor Generals due to the "great dearth of profound lawyers", similar to the lack of profound scholars in several of the learned professions.</p></abstract>
