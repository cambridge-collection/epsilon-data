            <abstract><p>Glad Smith accepted the unscientific collection of Australian plants from a "young Lieutenant of the Royal Navy" despite their faults, the collection included shells for himself and insects for [Alexander] Macleay. Has further dried plants to send to Smith. Received plants from [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert at Boyton. Bad weather, according to Herschel the next moon ought to be more favourable. Planning to visit Ireland in October for first time in five years. Received plants from Cordilleras, Trinidad, including the vegetable "arracacha", but has no guidance on growing it so keeping it in the hothouse. Expecting plants from [Nathaniel] Wallich including his whole collection of bulbs and 'Scitamineae', his [Annseley's] collections of both "now pretty rich". Gratified to receive seeds from Smith, especially as they had the Bishop of Norwich's [Henry Bathurst (1744-1837)] frank whom he believed was dead [Henry Bathurst (1744-1837)]. His son Lord Valentia has become a "florist".</p></abstract>
