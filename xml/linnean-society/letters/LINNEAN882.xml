            <abstract><p>Cullum writes: augmented Dawson Turner's "amazing" collection of autographs with letters from [Thomas] Pennant, Gough, Granger, Huddersford, Percy, [John] Latham, and others, Turner is considering publishing them. [James] Sowerby's death "a loss to science". Recently suffered a severe attack of vertigo and faintness which has been treated with leeches to the temples, blood letting from his arm, and two blisters on his back, but now on laying down has a general sinking uneasiness in the thorax and abdomen.</p><p>Transcribes paragraph from letter dated 9 January 1809 sent to him by Charles Miller [(c 1739-1817)], only son of Philip Miller, of the positive effects he gained from "friction or rather what in the East is called shampooing" following a paralytic stroke. Transcribes paragraph from a letter dated 28 February 1785 sent to him by his brother [Sir John Cullum, 6th baronet (1733-1785)], recounting a meeting with Smith shortly after his purchase of the Linnaean collections. [Joseph] Sabine intending to publish an account of [James] Dickson; recalls his first meeting and early memories of Dickson. Had hoped [Thomas] Rackett would receive a considerable legacy from old Mrs Garrick [Eva Marie Veigel (1724-1822), wife of the actor David Garrick] but it will not exceed Â£100.</p><p>F H Bathwell writes: thanks Smith for his letter, and is gratified that Smith is pleased with what has been done on his part.</p></abstract>
