            <abstract><p>In a "kind of torpor" and waiting for letter from Smith to reanimate his existence. Aware that Smith's "Sketch of a Tour on the Continent" now published. His last remaining aunt died 31 January of a sudden serious apoplexy at age of 74 and 8 months, having previously been in perfect health. Depressed by his own and his wife's illnesses and threat of invasion by French to his wife and son, and library and herbarium formed at expense of more than a third his patrimony. Asks for Smith's assistance in drawing up plans for a heated greenhouse as no mason or carpenter in his area has an idea of the matter; specifications. Requests copies of Smith's "Tour", volume two of "Linnean Transactions" (1794), and continuation of "English Botany", directions for them to be sent.</p><p>Note on left-hand margin of recto of first folio detailing most recent letters received from and sent to Smith.</p></abstract>
