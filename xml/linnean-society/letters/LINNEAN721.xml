            <abstract><p>The deaths of Dr [Edward] Rigby's [(1747-1821)] quadruplets reported in the newspapers; Goodenough very interested in the case and presumes from their weight that they were very small. Informed that Princess Charlotte's baby weighed 10 lbs [4.5 kg]; before the birth her size was described as alarming [the baby was stillborn and Princess Charlotte died shortly afterwards].</p><p>[Thomas] Marsham, his wife, and remaining daughter have moved from Winchmore Hill to Piccadilly, opposite the Lodge in Green Park. Goodenough refuses to have anything more to do with him, and has since heard that he was given £2000 and £200 per annum after losing his job at the West India Docks, but all was seized by other creditors; despairs of the Linnean Society ever recovering the money. Some in the Society say it is obliged to Marsham. "Immense numbers" seeking admission to the Society but [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert could only name two scientific naturalists.</p></abstract>
