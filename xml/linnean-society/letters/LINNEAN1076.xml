            <abstract><p>Confirms that a 'Hieracium' found last August by Travis in Scarborough not like any in "English Botany" appears to be 'Hieracium prenanthoides' in "English Botany", will bring specimen to London. His son returned from five weeks hunting in Leicestershire. Visited Sir Joseph Banks at Revesby Abbey, Lincolnshire, last October, where there was uncommonly good hunting but he hurt his leg. The 'Glaucium fulvum' grown from Smith's seeds "the most desireable plant" of its kind he knows and has distributed the seed as an acquisition to every garden. Banks "particularly well" though everyone alarmed about the gout medicine he has started taking; Duke of Gordon informed it is 'Gratida' which a medical friend of his gives with success, and having looked at Lewis' "Materia medica" the effects of 'Gratida' agree exactly with those of "Can medicinale".</p><p>Fears recent keen frost has injured apricot crop and hurt vines but successful with kale having had pots made with covers as proposed in note in "Hort. Trans", the convenience in examining plants very great. Frustrated that [Lewis Weston] Dillwyn [(1778-1855)] still has his 'Conferva' drawings two years after requesting their return.</p></abstract>
