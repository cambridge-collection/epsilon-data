            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letters of 15 and 28 [February ?]. Sent Smith information on the estates he is selling to be given to his Quaker friend and other interested parties. His family in good health, though his daughter [Mariamne Johnes] complains of headaches and she is to start taking Calx again as a precaution against the influenza currently raging in the country. Wishes the French would "keep themselves and their disorders at home".</p><p>His translation of Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler] going well, though had to dismiss his "rogue" of a printer and is expecting a replacement from Edinburgh. Todd [his gardener] is recovering from a head injury after falling from his horse, and had been suffering "jealous whims" though hopes they are gone with the blood the leeches took from his head.</p></abstract>
