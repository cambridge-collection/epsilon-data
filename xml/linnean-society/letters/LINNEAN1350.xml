            <abstract><p>Aware that his support for the "gradual abolition of the slave trade" could be misunderstood by his friends, but meant it to ensure the slaves' saftey and interests and not for the benefit of the merchants. Finds it inexplicable that William Smith has lost his Norwich seat, as "the slave trade is held in such general abhorence" there, and he has been one of its "most firm &amp; active opponents". Admires Smith's [epithet] for Alderman Baseley and praises Smith's "excellent turn" for this kind of composition. Details printing for his paper on Scitamineae. Intends to see [James] Sowerby about "Exotic botany", which must not be discontinued. Found a "Flora Peruviana &amp; Chilensis" in [Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron] Holland's [(1773-1840)] library containing figures of 'Canna', 'Costus', and 'Maruta', which he made copies of but forgot, and which confirm his and Smith's system [for determining 'Scitamineae' plants].</p></abstract>
