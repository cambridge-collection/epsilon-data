            <abstract><p>Spent Christmas at Sir Alexander Hume's in Hertfordshire. Hopes to have his usual annual party of [Samuel] Goodenough, [Thomas] Marsham, and [Jonas] Dryander to his house next week, with Woodward's turkey acting as his ambassador; comments on turkeys being introduced from America to south of France by Jesuits. Asks for the Woodwards assistance in finding the tale in verse of the City mouse &amp; country mouse" [note pasted to reverse of letter, in Smith's hand, with reference to Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift]. He is "well pleased" with his royal pupils, who are "very diligent &amp; apt"; returning after 4 June. Currently engaged in zoological lectures in London, has 16 subscribers, including Lord Stormont. Work on his "Tour" proceeded well at Frogmore.</p><p>Comments on 'Woodwardia'; on good grounds. Plans to figure 'Fucus abrotanifolius' in his uncoloured work. Error by [James] Sowerby in his figure of 'Cardamine impatiens' in "English botany". Praises beauty of [Edward] Donovan's [(1768-1837), natural historian] insect plates but the letterpress is "not scientific"; he is an "Irish compiling sort of adventurer in literature", previously published a "very bad" sixpenny botanical magazine. [Samuel] Goodenough still thinks the 'Fucus' Woodward mentioned is 'F. palmetta' of Gmelin.</p></abstract>
