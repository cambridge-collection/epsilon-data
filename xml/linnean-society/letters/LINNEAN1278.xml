            <abstract><p>Praises Smith's Cambridge pamphlet, which he thinks "unanswerable in argument" and will do much good; highlights chapter three and difficulty of explaining one's religious opinions, and Smith's defence of botany. After long debate it was decided to appoint permanent professors [to the Liverpool Royal Institution] and Smith was nominated professor of Botany, however there is no salary and renumeration based on arrangements made with the committee; requests Smith's repsonse. Thanks for Smith's letter and favourable opinion of his pamphlet. Pleased to hear of Smith's recovery and planned excursion with [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert; asks Smith to recommend the [Liverpool] Botanic Garden to Lambert so they can acquire an off-shoot of his just-flowered Peruvian 'Canna [iridiflora]'. The Garden is setting up a hothouse entirely for 'Scitamineae', to be supplied by Dr [William] Carey [(1761-1834)] of Serampore, [India], and [Nathaniel] Wallich of Calcutta, [India].</p><p>[Note in Smith's hand] recording date of letter, "yes".</p></abstract>
