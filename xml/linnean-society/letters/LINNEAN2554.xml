            <abstract><p>Thanks for Yates' letter, pleased he enjoyed his time at Norwich. Heard great things of Yates at Holkham [Hall, Norfolk, home of Thomas William Coke] and his skill with Coke's manuscripts. Asks Yates' opinion of Coke's marriage [in 1822 Coke married Lady Anne Amelia Keppel (1803-1844), 50 years his junior]; "Tories and bigots [...] hate Mr Coke for his virtues, but still more for his happiness".</p><p>Sorry to hear reports of Yates' father's [John Yates (1755-1826), Unitarian minister] ill health, "his loss will ill be supplied whenever he is taken away"; receives supports from his sister Martin, who is attached to Yates' family. Engaged with his "English Flora" and has little time for letter writing. Hopes to see Yates in London, he intends to be there from 5 May to till after 4 June.</p></abstract>
