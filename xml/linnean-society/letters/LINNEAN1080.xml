            <abstract><p>Illustrates "lamentable colouring" of 'Ulva plumosa' in "English Botany", which should have been "sap green", as in small coloured sketch [extant]; forgot to send one of the late flowering Gordon Castle, [Scotland], specimens. The late "tormenting" wife of [Alexander Gordon, 4th] Duke of Gordon [(1743-1827)] is now on road to be buried in Scotland and he has never been so happy.</p><p>Grafting: in [Thomas] Martyn's edition of [Philip] Miller's "The gardener's and botanist's dictionary" root grafting described as "a newer invention" but has succeeded in whip grafting 'Ilex' onto common oak, and surprised to find root grafting accurately described and extolled in Lowthorp's "Abridgement" vol 2 p.654. Delayed in coming to London by son's illness.</p><p>'Salix caprea' "Flora Britannica" is abundant in his woods but called 'sauve', reference to Marshall's "Yorkshire Glossary" "Saus - 'Salix caprea'". Found "host of holly natural layers, &amp; shall layer some hundreds".</p><p>Discussion of apple trees: received "Downton pippin, Golden Harvey, Grange apple, &amp; Foxley" from Hereford. Canker developed on his south wall Newton pippin which had fine crops for two years, observed with a lens the destruction of the eggs and insects under the diseased bark with turpentine. Forsyth says train oil is used in Kent, Forsyth himself prefers Torp seeds with terrie, thinks turpentine is as efficacious, plus more fluid and searching and its evaporation does not clog pores. Recommends Indian ink for nurserymens labels as it does not wash out.</p><p>Sketch of 'Ulex plumosa'.</p></abstract>
