            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 25 April. Expecting to leave [India] in two years and will bring with him a large collection, although it will not be as interesting as the one from Nepal. His collection of fish is more curious and increasing rapidly, has been unable to trace more than a few in Lacépède. This year is working in the Bhagalpur district of India. A squabble the previous year between the British and Nepalese governments has prevented him from obtaining seeds and flowering specimens of the officinal plants of the Indian Alps. Has managed to procure specimens of one genus, similar to 'Caltha', two species used for medicinal purposes and resemble either the 'Ranunculus arvensis' or 'Ranunculus acris', and another species which is one of the most violent poisons known in India and is used by the natives on their arrows.</p></abstract>
