            <abstract><p>Suffering from "a perpetual return of obstructions" and "excessive habit of costiveness" which no remedies will remove. Believes he has found 'Lichen confluens' and 'Lichen cinereo-fuscus' Weber, will send for Smith's consideration, and 'Lichen fulgens' Swartz or 'Lichen citrinus' Hedwig. Regrets his "ill treaty" with [Harvey] Spragg and his copy of Dillenius' "Historia Muscorum"; how many copies are buried in public libraries or in private hands whilst many including him "suffer &amp; linger by the privation". His interest in cryptogams; he sent Smith the common '[Lichen] fagineus' for pleasure of it authenticated by Smith, as he is still a novice.</p><p>Recently became acquainted with [Horace-Bénédict] de Saussure [(1740-1799)] and gave him roots of 'Geranium phaeum' and 'G. lividum', Swiss plants he had sought in vain, though he is more a lithologist than botanist. De Saussure collected lichens during an expedition on Mont Blanc, an account of which was published July 1788, and intended to send them to [Georg Franz] Hoffmann for identification but Davall persuaded him to send them to Smith instead. Transcribes, in French, part of de Saussure's letter acceptance, in French. Transcribes, in French, letter received from [Carlo] Bellardi with article for Smith.</p></abstract>
