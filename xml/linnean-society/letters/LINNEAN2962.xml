            <abstract><p>Pleased to hear Smith has [Edmund] Davall's herbarium. Is currently organising his Cape [of Good Hope] plants from [William] Roxburgh and [Arthur] Philip [(1738-1814) first governor of New South Wales], will give Smith duplicates. Letters arrived from the "Investigator" [Matthew Flinders' expedition to map Australian coast], surprise that they have already surveyed the unknown part of coast of New Holland from [?] to Bass Straits. [Ferdinand] Bauer [(1760-1826)] has made 360 drawings of new plants. A box of seeds has been sent. Asks of Smith's progress reviewing manuscript for Lambert's book "Description of the genus Pinus". Received books from Spain including complete works of [Antonio Jos√©] Cavanilles and fourth voulme of "Flora Peruviana", comments on the 'Alstroemeria' described therein. [Karl Friedrich von] Gaertner [(1772-1850)] is visiting and working on his herbarium. A group of Spaniards are currently in England and planning to travel to the interior of Africa, including [Simon de Roxas] Clemente [y Rubio]. Has fourteen numbers of "Annals of Natural History" from Spain. Encloses an unspecified item sent by the late Snelgrove of Norwich. Thanks Smith for herrings.</p></abstract>
