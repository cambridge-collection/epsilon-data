            <abstract><p>Frustrated by [Thomas] Marsham's delays in repaying his debts to the Linnean Society; blames those members who pitied and continued to think well of him and thinks Smith correct to call a Council, although uncertain if he can attend himself. Hopes that [Alexander] Macleay will be recompensed following break up of the Transport Board; he has spoken of leaving Queens Square. Bad harvest: the wheat in Cumberland is "very damaged" and none of the flowers in his garden had their usual rich odours, including the carnations, sweet peas, mignonette, but the 'Rosa semperflorens' was not affected by the weather; an example of its thorough hardiness, asks what its natural latitude is.</p><p>Hopes there are "no riotous doings" at Norwich, a "pefect system of terror prevails in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire", thinks it a pity that Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire should have been destroyed by Luddites [there were rumours that a fire at the castle was arson]. Isaac Milner [(c 1750-1820), Dean of Carlisle] is going to Cambridge, Goodenough has told him that Smith is the "most scientific naturalist extant" [Smith's campaign for botany professorship]. According to a letter from Ealing Sir Joseph Banks very ill.</p></abstract>
