            <abstract><p>Sends second number of "Icones pictae" and "Spicilegium botanicum"; Woodward's account. Tasted "the horrors of the damned" after "Icones pictae" was advertised in last number of "English botany" before it was ready and being repeatedly harassed by his friends for it. Sends missing sheet of "Flora Lapponica"; sent it as sheets supposing Woodward's bookbinders less corrupt than his. Delay in admitting Woodward's two nominations to Linnean Society.</p><p>The Reviews "very civil" towards "Linnean Transactions" vol 1, especially his "Introductory discourse", which has met with many compliments, including from Scarpa of Pavia who informs him of its translation into Italian by Father Fontana, professor of mathematics at Pavia University, and brother to Abbè Fontana; his own opinion of his discourse. Confirms that [Robert] Batty's [(1763-1849), apothecary] shop was destroyed by collapse of the Pantheon following a fire, his shop was under the stage. François [Borone] and [Adam] Afzelius had embarked [for Sierra Leone] but their ship had an accident at Deal, [Kent], and is being refitted. Can accommodate Woodward for anniversary meeting, though his brother, John, may also be in London.</p></abstract>
