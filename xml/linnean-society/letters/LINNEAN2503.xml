            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's "delightful letter" of 11 March [1809] and Smith's sentiments concerning his fianc√©e. Pleased Smith was satisfied with the review of Smith's "Introduction to Botany" by his friend, [Henry] Steinhauer, who is now reviewing Parkinson's "Organic remains of a former world". Offers to translate review of the "Introduction" in Schrader's journal.</p><p>Recently found 'Galanthus nivalis' and 'Viola adorata' but no 'Anemone' or 'Ranunculus' has yet flowered with them. Remarks on various genera, including: 'Geranium', 'Erica', 'Smithia'. Asks if Smith ever received White's paper he sent on "Inflammation of the liver". Friends he has made through study of botany. Dispute with Sprengel over 'Aster salignus', which Sprengel sent as 'Boltonia salicifolia'; Sprengel's eccentricities regarding access to the Halle botanic garden.</p><p>He and his friends have proposed establishing a circulating library here, in spite of the narrow-mindedness of the locals, citing example of parents who were anxious at his teaching their children geography.</p></abstract>
