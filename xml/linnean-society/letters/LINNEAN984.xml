            <abstract><p>Note by Davall letter received 20 November.</p><p>Received no letters from Davall since 13 April and 19 June though he spoke of a long letter in gestation since January. Visited [Thomas] Johnes in Wales, "a man of taste, feeling, liberality &amp; large fortune" with whom he became acquainted through his "Tour" and considers it repayment for losing the Queen by it. Moved from Marlborough Street to Hammersmith in September and now lives within 50 yards of Lee's garden, who died in the summer, succeeded by his son. Did not receive Davall's letter and 'Digitalis' seeds of 30 November. Marrying daughter of old friend of his father's and friend of his second sister's in March, her tastes the same as his. Spending next summer with Johnes, his ten year old daughter [Mariamne Johnes] "a most determined botanist &amp; entomologist". Lady Rockingham in bad health following injudicious bleeding last summer. His eldest sister still single. [Adam] Afzelius expected from Sierra Leone, and [Francis] Masson [(1741-1805), Kew plant collector], [Archibald] Menzies, [John] Sibthorp are back in England, and [John] White from Botany Bay. Received letter from Broussonet dated Gibraltar; he can now return to France and his friends and property are all safe.</p></abstract>
