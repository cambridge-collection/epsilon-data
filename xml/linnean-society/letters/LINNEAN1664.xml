Resolved to not go further than reptiles in his lectures now, and will leave fish, insects, and worms for another year; course ends 16 May. Offered to make Lord Darmouth an Honorary Member of the Linnean Society, he deferred. Court party uneasy about the city agitations and dread Sir Fra[...]s's liberation. [Richard] Westall [(1765-1836), painter] exhibiting his pictures at his house; he is "very kind, as usual".</p><p>[Letter incomplete: small cropped section pasted over second folio, missing text presumed destroyed. Comparison of the paper of the two folios suggests this may have once been two separate letters]</p></abstract>
