            <abstract><p>Received the most recent numbers of Smith's "Icones Pictae" and "Spicilegium Botanicum". Would like Smith's opinion of his manuscript "Flora Dubliniensis", having heard from [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert that Smith has seen it. Asks if [Pierre] Bulliard [(1752-1793), botanist] has published anymore of his ["Herbia de la France"] since 1780. Had suspected the author of "English Botany" was someone "first rate" and is not disappointed [Smith's "English Botany" was originally published anonymously]; suggests improving it by including the general size of plants and differences noted when much similarity occurs. Not impressed with [Thomas Martyn's] "Flora Rustica", particularly its lack of originality and inferior paper and plates. Thanks for Smith's pledge of support for his plans to promote natural history in Ireland but is increasingly realising the futility of this in spite of Ireland's natural treasures. Shall communicate any Irish natural history findings to the Linnean Society. Andrew Caldwell sends his compliments and hopes Smith received his pamphlets.</p></abstract>
