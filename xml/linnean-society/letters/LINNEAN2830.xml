            <abstract><p>Requests specific works of [Louis Éconches] Feuillée [(1660-1732) French botanist] and foreign plants and seeds not found in Britain, makes specific requests from Pisa [contracted and abbreviated to illegibility]. Asks if 'Thea' trees are plentiful in Genoa. List of desiderata at end of letter. Specifically asks for seeds of 'Stellaria [dichotoma]' from Switzerland and Siberia to convince him of his error in thinking it can be British as well as Swiss considering that 'Fritillaria meleagris' and 'Epilobium [alpinum]' grow wild in England. Thanks for books, happy that Gaubius escaped flames. Advises Smith to thoroughly edit and correct his thesis before publishing it and admonishes him for blindly accepting all of Linnaeus' tenets from his writings alone, complains this is all that is needed for a first degree from Oxford or Cambridge. Pleased Smith can access the collections of [Joseph de] Jussieu, [Sébastien] Vaillant and others. General wish for an enlarged edition of the "Systema Vegetibilum". Clarification of statement on 'Coffea occidentalis'.</p><p>Asks Smith to consult Cupani's "Hortus Catholicus" and the "Supplemen alterum" in Naples; lists plants and other authors [heavily abbreviated and contracted]. Smith's 'Sisymbrium tenuifolium' "continues as a 'Brassica'", asks if it is the Betel of the Medes and Persians. Relates that [William] Curtis is learning botany at [Norwich] under "R. P." and others, believes the value of the "Flora Londinensis" will rise. A pupil of [Richard] Relhan's states that most British plants are to be found in Cambridgeshire so we may expect a "Flora Cantabrigiensis" soon. Has seen the "aurelian" Clara Reeve's [(1729-1807) novelist and poet] collection of shells, and has sent her Linnaeus' "Venus". Two of the plants in the desiderata are for Reeve.</p></abstract>
