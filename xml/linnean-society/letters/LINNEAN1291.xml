            <abstract><p>Waiting to hear from Samuel Taylor whether he can take on Roscoe's son, James, as student of farming, as he has just taken on another pupil. Glad Roscoe received books. [William Fitt] Drake became severely ill with inflammation of lungs and fever after [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden] left Norwich; very concerning on account of both his parents dying young of consumption and his being at a "critical age"; his membership of the rifle corps has added to the anxiety, though thinks Drake will be safe from dangers of "idleness, a taste for drink, &amp; low company" which face other young men.</p><p>Intends to publish third volume of his "Flora [Britannica]" soon; the "labour of the mosses was very great" and anticipates many corrections from "hardworking Germans", he knows no one who will follow his "systematic niceties". Flattered by Roscoe's praise of his "Tour of the Continent". Gives value for Columna's works, including prices paid by Sir Joseph Banks and [Edmund] Davall, whose copies they are and which Smith is selling. They have begun work on Roscoe's herbarium but unsure of progress. His bust "much approved, &amp; arrived very safe".</p></abstract>
