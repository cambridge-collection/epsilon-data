            <abstract><p>Thanks for turkey. Had he known would have contributed to Smith's collection for George Don's widow instead of Patrick Neill's. Fears Neill may have endangered a reasonable subscription by aiming to raise enough for a permanent provision for Don's widow.</p><p>Many people, including [Amelia Warren] Griffiths [(1768-1858), algologist], [Elizabeth] Hill [(c 1760-1850), algologist], and Miss Hutchins, are complaining that [Dawson] Turner detains Sir Joseph Banks' collection, does not answer queries, or acknowledge or send back specimens. Many also complain that he has not published any numbers [of his "Fucus"] for over a year. Everyone anxious to see the outcome of Buonaparte's invasion of France but are baffled that after losing two armies of 500,000 each he has been allowed to return with a third army; Goodenough thinks Napoleon's case is "unique in the history of man".</p></abstract>
