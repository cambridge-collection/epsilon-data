            <abstract><p>Death of his father, on 8 March, after long period of fluctuating health. His journey to Norwich in spite of his own ill health. Consolation that he had wrapped up all his business to his satisfaction and had no particular anxieties, especially as his brother, John, has given up going to America; both dreaded and hoped for final interview with Smith. His grandmother to move into the family home. Account of autopsy performed by Mr Martineau, which revealed an ulcerous kidney.</p><p>Responds to Woodward's letter of 21 January [1795]: defends 'Mimosa' against Mrs Woodward's accusations; has not heard from [Edmund] Davall for some time; [William] Curtis' 'Goodenia laevigata' is his 'G. albida', never saw it without white flowers till recently. Death of Fran√ßois [Borone] at Athens, by a fall from a window in his sleep; much affected by it.</p></abstract>
