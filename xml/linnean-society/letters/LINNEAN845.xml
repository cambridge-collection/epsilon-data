            <abstract><p>Attended a dinner at Clare Hall, Cambridge, with [William] Webb and Dr [Martin] Davy, who hopes for Smith's success [in campaign for Cambridge botany professorship]; neither [George] Leathes [(1779-1836)] or Davies were mentioned [Smith's rivals for professorship]. The university divided on mode of election as there has not been one for a botanical professor for fifty years, and whether the college heads can reduce the number of candidates to two.</p><p>Attended Linnean Club dinner; [Alexander] Macleay in chair supported by [William] Smith and [Joseph] Sabine, William Webb admitted a FLS by Sabine, [Edward and Thomas Furly] Forster also present, [William George] Maton absent on account of death of his father, and [Thomas] Marsham absent until "times are better with him". Sir Everard Home [(1756-1832), physician], took chair at Royal Society as Sir Joseph Banks too ill, two archdukes who wanted to become FRS announced and duly elected. A botanical publication brought from Paris by Bowater for [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert seized with the contraband items it was packed with. [William Elford] Leach, "the great zoological reformer", has been elected FRS and Duke of Norfolk [Bernard Howard (1765-1842)] nominated by Banks. Presumes Smith and the Council will propose a plan for amending Linnean Society finances.</p><p>Hopes [William Elford] Leach's long paper in the new volume of "Linnean Transactions" ['A tabular View of the external Characters of Four Classes of Animals'] will not lead the Society to be called the "Crabby, or Crusty Society".</p></abstract>
