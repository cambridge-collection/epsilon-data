            <abstract><p>Contents of Linnean Society charter satisfactory, with the only remaining difficulty being the number of names in it; the Attorney and Soliciter General suggested the first Council, which was rejected by himself, [Thomas] Marsham, and Sir Joseph Banks on account of cost, so they are now examining precedents to include as few names as possible, or to otherwise limit Council names to 15.</p><p>Encloses letter, to be returned, which has recently caused much discord at the Society; account of the business, apparently related to nomination of [Johann Karl Adam] Murhard [(1781-1863)] as a FMLS.</p><p>[Richard] Pulteney has left his museum to the Society provided they keep it as a separate collection, or that it be sold at auction, the price being made up to Â£200 if necessary, and given to the Society for purchase of an annual medal of 5 guineas for best botanical paper. Banks has behaved "handsomely" to the Society.</p></abstract>
