            <abstract><p>Thanks Smith for naming plant ['Roscoea'] after him in September issue of "Exotic botany"; discusses its claims to be a distinct genus based on his system. Unsure whether he should include the synoptical table in his 'Scitamineae' paper on account of it being "in the very teeth of Lin[naeu]s".</p><p>Ready to receive first parcel of herbarium Smith is preparing, and though [Liverpool Botanic] garden funds currently low is confident of success of a subscription for the herbarium. Has orders for several quatro copies of "Exotic botany"; asks [James] Sowerby to send direct rather than through booksellers. Suggests Sowerby and his son tour England to draw rare plants in private collections as research for "Exotic botany". Still considers Smith the "destined Editor of the works of Linnaeus"; discusses whether Smith should publish them by subscription. Proposes Lord [Edward Smith-]Stanley as FLS and requests certificate for his nomination.</p></abstract>
