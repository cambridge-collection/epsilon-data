            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letters of 24 May and 4 June. Obliged to Sir Thomas Frankland's enquiries; sorry he has had such losses and recalls dining with him and his family at Edward's five years ago; "they were beautiful girls but I did not then think them in such danger". Charles Greville [(1749-1809), mineralogist and horticulturist] has promised Mrs Johnes a true peony when he has propogated it. Critises Symmons' character for "wanting everything another has", which reminds him of "Bonielli's speech of his cousin LaFayette".</p><p>Smith's intentions regarding Hafod views are "magnificent" and thinks if they are done well and limited in number they will sell well. Intends to have a small map of his grounds made which Smith may have for the work ["A tour to Hafod, in Cardiganshire" (1810)] .</p><p>[Dr Thomas] Beddoes [(1760-1808), chemist and physician] has "behaved vastly well indeed" and his patient, [Mariamne Johnes], is so improved Smith would not know her. Return to Hafod delayed in case Mariamne would be exhausted by the numbers who might come to her birthday. Calx muricata must be "an extraordinary good medicine"; Mariamne's recovery owed to it. Beddoes made a surprising cure of Dr Briggs, from Ceylon, who had lost 20 pounds of blood and given up on by London practitioners; Beddoes used 'Digitalis' in very small quantities and is to publish the case. Recommends Smith read "Memories of Modern Philosophers" 2, written by a woman.</p></abstract>
