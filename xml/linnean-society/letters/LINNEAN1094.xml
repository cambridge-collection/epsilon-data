            <abstract><p>Too late to suggest examination of his theory that the first flight of woodcocks consists only of males and the second flight of hens and young. Thirkleby has few in any season and the thirty he examined last year were all males, and that from the mildness of the winter thinks no second flight came over. Has only seen four this year so far and they were all males.</p><p>Sir Joseph Banks in good health and has only missed dining at the Club two days in the season. Some of the chili seeds sent [from Lima, Peru] by Commodore Bowles [his nephew] are 'Araucaria imbricata'; [James] Lee has raised several. His son called away by Parliament. An unknown bird shot in Wiltshire stubble identified by Nicholas as a "Jamaica quail" from stuffed specimen at Leadbeaters after Banks and [William Elford] Leach erroneously named it as a red-legged partridge, thinks it escaped from a collection.</p></abstract>
