            <abstract><p>Sir Thomas Frankland would send any letters of her husband's [Sir James Edward Smith] if he had them; he has been nervously ill for ten years and almost lost the use of his limbs. Glad the Linnean Society took on his plan [fund for purchase of Smith's collections by Linnean Society], subscribed £100 himself, and Lloyd £500. Believes he has lost or mislaid some of Smith's letters but did not destroy any, will collect them when next in Bury. Brief account of visit from General [Thomas] Hardwicke. Frequently sees [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert. Family deaths: his second son died suddenly last August, and his sister Mrs Palmer died a few weeks afterwards at ninety-one years old. Eldest son has a sixteen years old daughter [Susannah Arethusa Cullum], his deceased son no children.</p></abstract>
