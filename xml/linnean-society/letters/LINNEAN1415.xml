            <abstract><p>Describes his journey from Norwich to Wales, via Worcester, Ludlow, where he saw 'Inula helenium', Bishop's Castle, New Town, and Aberystwyth. Praises setting and interior of Johnes' house. Johnes' daughter, [Mariamne Johnes], "though not above 10 years of age has taken a wonderful turn for botany &amp; entomology"; her skills. Disappointed by botany in Wales, observing only common plants of hilly, not alpine countries, and mosses and lichens chiefly of the tree kind: 'Lichen laetevirens', 'L. glomuliferus', 'L. scrobienlatus', 'L. sylvaticus', 'L. resupinatus', 'L. plumbens' all common, found one 'L. perlatus' in fructification, 'Hypericum dubium' lately observed near Worcester is one of the common things here, thinks it overlooked for 'H. perforatum'.</p><p>The Johnes' family are the "guardian angels of the country", and consequently not liked by the neighbouring gentry, "who want to keep up all the old tyrannic notions, &amp; never think of other people's starving"; [Thomas] Johnes lately imported a ship-load of wheat from Bristol to sell at a loss. Harvest here and all over the country is "fine"; hop-grounds of Shropshire "are beautiful". Sends 'Hypericum dubium' and 'Gnaphalium' which he took to be the true 'H. sylvaticum' but must be 'H. rectum' of "English botany".</p><p>Following his stay at Hafod intends to visit Dr Parr at Llandilo and then his aunt and her grandchildren at Bath. Lack of limestone, chalk, or gravel here leaves the flora poor, with 'Solidago virgaurea', 'Serratula tinctoria', and 'Hypericum dubium' growing prodigiously. [Andrew] Caldwell disappointed of his Guernsey expedition. Johnes' expensive taste in literature.</p></abstract>
