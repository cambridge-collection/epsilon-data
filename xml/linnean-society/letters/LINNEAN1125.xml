            <abstract><p>Glad the recipe she sent [mutton suet boiled in milk] has almost cured his cough. Her gardener, Grieg, is almost better; his lungs had a narrow escape. She has had a stomach complaint but did not seek medical attention, it being rare to meet with physicians with Smith's "sentiments of the imperfection of human knowledge".</p><p>Invites Smith and [Joseph von] Jacquin to visit next week; warns Jacquin not to expect her present collection of plants to be the "celebrated" one he heard of as there have been so many new plants since then that she does not think he will see anything new to him.</p></abstract>
