            <abstract><p>Relieved to receive Henriette Davall's account of his health. Thinks Davall's disorder is debility and prescribes Peruvian bark taken in peppermint tea, does not see the benefit of a milk diet and recommends plain light meats, warns against too debilitating a plan in case it causes apoplexy, fits, and fainting, not to load stomach with physic or food, take light plain broth or a little solid meat and keep bowels gently open. For uneasiness in head recommends bathing legs and feet in warm water before bed. Suspects he has taken too much physic and has too "Sangrado-like" a doctor [sangrado, Spanish for bleeding].</p><p>Lists his plans and destinations for year. Continuing work on "Flora Britannica" though currently cannot do more than five plants a day, just through 'tetrandria', grasses very troublesome. Sorry Davall has not received "English Botany" 42 to 66 he sent with letter of 2 November 1796 listing his reasons for moving to Norwich - domestic comfort, cheapness, command of time, and good air, his health much better. Offers to send "English Botany" and [James] Sowerby's "Fungi".</p></abstract>
