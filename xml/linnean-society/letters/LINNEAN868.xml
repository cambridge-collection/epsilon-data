            <abstract><p>Lady Cullum losing her eyesight to cataracts but Sir William Adams [(1783-1827), oculist] will not operate till she is almost completely blind in both eyes, hopes it can be done by May as warmer summer months not suitable.</p><p>Attended Royal Society meeting and dinner; Sir Joseph Banks too ill to attend but [Davies] Gilbert, Mr Raper, Dr [John] Latham, and [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert did. Was not aware of Mrs [Catherine] Lambert's "deplorable state" until seeing the muffled rapper on Lambert's door; a letter from Sir George Staunton says she continues in the same way, he has lately bought an estate at Leigh in Hampshire. Received from Copenhagen the continuation of "Flora Danica", observes that "Flora Britannica" and "English Botany" are frequently quoted, along with [Thomas] Velley and late [John] Stackhouse. Congratulates Smith on his appointment to botanical professorship at the Royal Institution. Flattered by Smith's article on 'Cullumia' in [Abraham] Rees' "Cyclopedia" which has been copied by Dr [John] Sims in the "Botanical Magazine". Encloses note for Smith's neighbour, Stevenson [not extant].</p></abstract>
