            <abstract><p>His son broke his collar bone in a hunting accident but had good fortune to meet his surgeon on way home, hopeful of good recovery considering Duke of Portland's recovery from his many accidents.</p><p>Timber prices: informed by Dr Barham of Kent that Lord Despenser has lately sold English fir for 2500 at 3/9 per foot, and by Duke of Gordon that [James] Brodie has just also sold some advantageously; advising his friends to not pay more than 10d per cubic foot for Riga timber, it is now 5/8 at York, and there is none in Stockton-on-Tees, [County Durham] where it is usually sold.</p><p>Pleased with [Dawson] Turner's work [probably "Fucus sive plantarum fucorum..." (1808-1819)], Turner's 'T. pusillus' was amongst the drawings he sent Turner, found at Exmouth, [Devon], in 1799. Sent Turner receipt for an effective rheumatism medicine received from Hoppover two years ago.</p></abstract>
