            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 14 [September]. Spent the week with "our friend Edwards" and a French friend of his, who confirmed suspicions that they were ignorant of what was happening in France; it would take a volume "as big as Boswell's "Life of Johnson" to inform Smith of all the information he learnt. Unluckily, Mariamne's new master, Signor Bianchi, came whilst they were staying and "the Frenchman &amp; Italian were in a constant scene of war". Convinced he will like the plates of Hafod, and Edwards is pushing for 250 copies as he is sure they will sell.</p><p>Thanks for the seeds. Asks if Smith thinks maize will grow here, as he wishes to introduce polenta to his poor people, and the stalks would feed pigs. Will finish his first volume of Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler] before Christmas. Requests same quantity of fearnought [thick cloth for overcoats] as last year.</p><p>Under another cover sends Smith a specimen of a mineral found here which none of the miners know what it is. Asks the value of manganese and best market for it. Anticipates valuable deposits of lead and copper in Beulahwalter hill opposite his house, though it will spoil the scenery and cause a contest between avarice and pleasure. [Thomas] Beddoes [(1760-1808), chemist and physician] has had a sever ague.</p></abstract>
