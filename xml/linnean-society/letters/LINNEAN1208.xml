            <abstract><p>Received Smith's Bristol letter. Repeats from his last letter his financial losses in sale of Croft, but now finds that he cannot get the money coming to him as a neglected fine has been found. Wrote to his solicitor about Smith's draft but cannot as yet get the money unlocked.</p><p>His daughter [Mariamne Johnes] "going on well" and now walks without crutches. Mr Abernethy advises for her, via Dr [David] Davies, seabathing and an enlargement of the tissues, but Johnes attributes the swelling in her thigh to sea bathing two years ago; "they seem all in the dark".</p><p>Lists previous members of Parliament for Radnorshire, from Sir Henry Howarth to the present day. Curious to hear anything of Sir George Chad, who is either "an extraordinary friendly man, or a consunmate charlatan", after he assisted Hanbury Williams [possibly Johnes' brother-in-law, married to his sister Eliza] with debt-planning and relieved him of his troubles.</p></abstract>
