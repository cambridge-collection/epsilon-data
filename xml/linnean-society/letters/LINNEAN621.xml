            <abstract><p>Divinity is his principal study but always delighted to be diverted by natural history. Justifies his alterations of Smith's Latin in his previous letter and discusses Greek and Latin philology. Dr Vaughan "in high vogue" in Rochester. Has altered the title-page for "Flora Graeca" [extant, on a separate sheet]; explains his decisions. Asks if [John] Sibthorp applied Theophratsus' and Dioscorides' names to his plants. Shall look for his sketch of "the air plant"; gathered his ideas of its physiology from [Engelbert] Kaempfer [(1651-1716), German naturalist] and his directions to the Duchess' gardener for its management led to its only flowering in England. Hopes Smith is not making too many species of lichen in the 'crustacei' and 'leprosi' divisions, asks if they have been watched from year to year in their changes. Instructing Lady Mary Thynne [(d 1863), wife of John Thynne, 3rd baron Carteret (1772-1849)] in botany; will request specimens of [Dawson] Turner for himself and her. Saw [Thomas] Marsham and [Alexander] Macleay; thinks Marsham "overpowered with too much business".</p></abstract>
