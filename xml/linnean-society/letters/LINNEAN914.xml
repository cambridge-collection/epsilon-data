            <abstract><p>Afraid to tell Smith of his marriage lest he thought him "a deserter of the good cause"; tells Smith about his wife.</p><p>Botanical queries: is there a good figure of true 'Carex saxatilis'; is the true 'Bromus pinnatus' of L.Fl. the 'Bromus pinnatus' of [William] Hudson; when will Smith publish his volume of "Obs[ervationes] Bot[anicae]"; when is fifteenth edition of "Systema Vegetabilium" published. Intends to send Smith the drawings for his work, though fears it will not be complete before Smith finishes his "Systema Vegetabilium". The young [Albrecht von] Haller [(1758-1823)] and [Jacob] Wyttenbach disapprove of his proposed title "Illustrationes Hall.", proposes "Florilegium Helveticum" instead. Berne booksellers wish to reprint [Abrecht von] Haller's [(1708-1777)] "Historia Stirpium" and have requested Davall's plates; [Werner de] Lachenal [(1736-1800)] declines to edit it as he wishes to keep his discoveries for his own "Flora Helvetica".</p><p>Criticises [Nikolaus von] Jacquin's "wretched" figure of 'Arenaria liniflora' in "Collectanea" vol 2. Asks for [James] Dickson to respond to his questions on cryptogamia. Sent Smith 'Lichen cucullatus' and seed of 'Geranium pusillum' for William Curtis, and 'Stellaria biflora' of Linnaeus and 'Stellaria cerastoides'. Has specimen of extremely rare 'Sisymbrium tanacetifolium' for Smith. Requests permission to quote Smith's work on 'Sonchus [alpinus]' and 'Stellaria dichotoma'. Longs to study coloured plates of 'Limodorum', 'Tankervilli', and 'Strelitzia', and for [James] Sowerby to copy Miss Lee's drawing of 'Protea mellifera'. Comments on Jacquin's figure of 'Senecio sarracenicus' and 'Senecio nemorensis' in "Flora Austrica". Seeds of 'Hieracium alpinum' for Smith, discusses this plant with reference to [Carlo] Allioni and [John] Lightfoot and degradation of colour in herbarium specimens including 'Trifolium incarnatum'. Difficulties with 'Chenopodium' and discrepancies with Haller. Offers to send paper with drawings on 'Gentiana pedunculata' for Linnean Society, discusses its flower and similarities to 'Swertia carinthiaca' with five small ink sketches. Will send 'Carex tomentosa'. Asks after Smith's ["Icones pictae plantarum rariorum..."] and [Richard] Salisbury's ["Icones stirpium rariorum..."]. Thinks that Wyttenbach "should stick to his minerals" after sending Smith 'Stellaria cerastoides' for 'Cerastium alpinum' to Smith, and the same to himself as 'Arenaria multicaulis'. Small sketch in ink of his newly made herbarium cabinet in the same style as Smith's; ambitions for his collection. Indebted himself Â£600 in setting up his library.</p></abstract>
