            <abstract><p>Asks after new numbers of "Icones pictae" and "Spicilegium botanicum". Approves of enlarged "English botany" [from 3 to 6 plates per number], thinks it will increase sales amongst botanists though the number ordered for Bungay has fallen from 5 to 2, previously bought "as pretty pictures".</p><p>Expects to hear from [Samuel] Goodenough on 'Fucus palmetta' following his examination of the Linnaean and Sir Thomas Frankland's specimens, asks Smith's opinion of the Cromer 'Fucus' resembling 'F. furcellatus' and Gmelin's 'F. rotundus'. [William] Withering at Lisbon; he had been extremely ill with pulmonary complaints but recovered; happy to hear Smith has approved Withering's 'Agaric' species but the 'Fucus' are a bad copy of [William] Hudson's and thinks Velley should have helped him better.</p><p>Discusses origin of turkeys in Europe. Unable to find verse version of the "City &amp; Country Mouse" story. Warns Smith not to fall in love with Princess Elizabeth [(1770-1840), daughter of George III]; rumoured that Dr J Willis did and thought it reciprocal; finds it odd that she, who is "least handsome", has been "most admired"; rumoured that Smith's sister was offered Miss [Fanny] Burney's [(1752-1840), novelist and Second Keeper of the Robes to the Queen] place but refused it. Asks how Smith is to publish his ferns.</p></abstract>
