            <abstract><p>Sends perfect copy of his "Tour" and copies of his "New Holland" work; particularly pleased with his description of 'Billardiera'. Examined 'Fucus confervoides' of Linnaean herbarium and confirms it is 'F. vesuicosus' [William] Hudson and not 'F. albidus', finds no 'F. incurous' Hudson in herbarium. Mr Egerton the only one of [Samuel] Goodenough's pupils to die [from a fever at Goodenough's school]. Visited North Walsham, [Norfolk], to meet botanist Revd Mr Hepworth. Will be in Norwich in June to lecture on botany and zoology for 6 weeks.</p><p>Thanks for Woodward's good opinion of his "Tour"; opinion of others including his Windsor friend and Sir Abraham and Lady [Amelia] Hume, despite Sir Abraham being a friend of [Edmund] Burke [(1730-1797), politician] and an "alarmist"; has heard nothing of De Luc's or the Queen's [Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744-1818)] opinion; only criticism received so far is from his "honest but bigotted friend" [Thomas] Marhsam, "a furious friend of the slave trade &amp; an enemy of Dr [Joseph] Priestly [(1733-1804), theologian]", who says he did wrong in mentioning Priestly.</p><p>[Letter incomplete: lower two-thirds of second folio cropped, text presumed destroyed]</p></abstract>
