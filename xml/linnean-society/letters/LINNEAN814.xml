            <abstract><p>Received visit from [Thomas] Marsham who says the 'Mentha' he sent Smith is 'Mentha sativa'; asks how figure in "English Botany" 448 resembles no.21 in [William] Sole's book ["Menthae Britannicae"]. Does not think Sole is a very skilled botanist, pointing out that Sole considers Dr [John] Hill [(c 1716-1775)] one of the first botanists. Hopes Smith received the parcel of Scottish plants sent by his son from Mr Bruce.</p><p>Hears "Flora Britannica" progresses well, recommends providing a reference for plants also appearing in "English Botany". Revd [Henry John] Wollaston has seen 'Senecio paludosus' growing abundantly in ditches near Brayford Water near Lincoln and at Nocton Fen on banks of River Witham leading to Boston, [Lincolnshire], proposes him as a FLS. Lately received letter from [Samuel] Goodenough. Dr [George] Shaw's 'Bradypus ursinus' was exhibited during the Bury Fair; agrees with [Thomas] Bewick's "Quadrupeds" that it is of the genus 'Ursus' and the animal in Bury is male whereas that shown in [Holborn] was a female, makes brief observations, in Latin.</p></abstract>
