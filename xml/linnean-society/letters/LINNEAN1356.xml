            <abstract><p>Sorry he could not see Smith again before leaving London. Describes his return to Liverpool: express coaches were organised to hasten his return from London and he was welcomed into Liverpool by friends, though on reaching the Exchange a "scene took place" which he has described in the enclosed paper [extant - JES/COR/17/48] [Roscoe found himself in the centre of a riot orchestrated by local slave traders]. The election is to commence shortly and there are only two candidates, but he does not dare exposing himself and his friends to the to "public vengeance" directed against him.</p></abstract>
