            <abstract><p>Expects his campaign for Cambridge botany professorship to be successful. Received encouraging letter from [Thomas] Martyn [incumbent professor of botany] explaining the three-part composition of his botanical professorship: the university professorship, elected by Senate; the Regius professorship, given by the King; and the garden and lectureship founded by Dr [Richard] Walker [(1679-1764)]. Martyn has proposed to resign the garden lectureship in favour of Smith to allow him to gain an interest for when the others become vacant. Discusses his plans to canvas for the garden and lectureship and expects his rivals, Brook, [George] Leathes [(1779-1836)], and [Richard] Relhan to withdraw. Received assistance from Cullum's friend [William] Webb. Intends to go to London, Cambridge, and then home. Gathered 'Monotropa' in woods near to this place.</p></abstract>
