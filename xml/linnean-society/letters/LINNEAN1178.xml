            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter; pleased to hear he is to visit and gives directions for the most convenient route from Hereford. Coach details and places of interest on the route, including: Lord Maldon's house, Hampton Court, on way to Leominster, built in Henry IV's reign and with a "curious old picture of that king and a fine portrait of Lord Abergaveney"; his mother's house, Croft Castle, five miles on other side of Leominster, which has beautiful woods; Thebden Court, home of Lord Bateman, where there are some good pictures and a "fine statue of Mercury"; and Alderman Hadley has built a new house, Burrington, but he himself is not an admirer of Mr Holland's architecture. Ludlow one of prettiest towns he knows and recommends Smith take a day to see [Richard Payne] Knight's [(1750-1824), classicist] Downton Castle; Oakley Park is also pretty and near Ludlow, and there are magnificent view from the Bishop's Moat.</p></abstract>
