            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter yesterday; responds to point about his housekeeper and gratuities paid to his staff by guests by reiterating that he "cannot help it" and that the majority of those touring this area treat it as a "conquered country" and "their dirty conduct is scarce credible". His orders have been for the housekeeper to take 2/6 from single persons, and 5/ from groups, and though she is an excellent servant she is "certainly fond of gaining money" and feels hurt that at those who "pompously come in curricle" offer only a shilling. Quotes part of a poem in French. Everything he hears against the peace confirms him more in it.</p><p>Informs Smith that Symmons has bought a place near Llanelly and hears "he has married his whore". Mrs Johnes thanks Smith for seeds of 'Veratium'.</p></abstract>
