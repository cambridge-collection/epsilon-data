            <abstract><p>Thinks his son, Edmund, is the best appointment for headmaster of Westminster School. Believes that the discontent in the country is the fault of "itinerants who [...] poison the minds of everyone" by teaching them to think "they are denied every comfort". Uncertain what has been done at Manchester but the Attorney General confident he will prove at the trials that the magistrates and yeomanry deserved praise, not censure, in defending themselves [at Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819 cavalry charged into a large crowd demanding parliamentary reform, killing fifteen]. A meeting of radicals presided over by [Thomas Jonathan] Wooler [(1786-1853), journalist and radical] to be held on Monday, with the Whigs calling for another meeting the following day. Not surprised by Smith's account of the Russian train with the Archdukes. One of Goodenough's young male servants died of an inflammation thirty hours after drinking cold water when hot; his father lives with Colonel Woodhouse at Witten Hall, Norfolk.</p></abstract>
