            <abstract><p>His infirm health and increasing debility prevent him from joining the Smiths at Holkham, [Norfolk, home of Thomas William Coke]; reflections on approaching death. Endeavouring to finish his literary work with all reasonable speed: revising his catalogue of Holkham manuscripts for last time, including Mr Madden's additions; finishing his "Mondandrian Plants" with the 15th number; and finishing his pamphlet on American penitentiary system with advocation for a system equally desireable in this country if not for its "old institutions &amp; inveterate prejudices".</p><p>Thanks for Smith's remarks on his descriptions of Monandrian plants and assents to Smith's opinion regarding 'Renealmia'; will place in it the 'Cardamom' plant, radical flowering 'Alpinia', and other plants which according to their system are not in any other genus. Received from [William] Carey [(1761-1834)] in Serampore four flowers of 'Curcuma' preserved in spirits. Had been anxious about [Nathaniel] Wallich after hearing he had remained behind the embassy among the Burmese, but now hears he is expected in about a month with an "immense cargo" of living and dried plants including 'Curcuma' and 'Crina'; the 'Scitamineae' Wallich promised him will be too late for his purposes now.</p></abstract>
