            <abstract><p>Confined to his house for the last three weeks but almost recovered. [Liverpool Botanic Garden] has purchased [Thomas] Velley's herbarium, including his marine specimens. Asks if his "Rocket against the French botanists" [paper comparing systems of Linnaeus and Jussieu, see RelatedMaterial below] has been read yet; thinks he can now fully explain the distinction between a natural and artificial system; wishes the animosities between Britain and France could be confined "within such harmless limits" but the business of "cutting throats" now seems to be a permanent state of society. Published some brief observations on speech by Lord [Thomas] Grey [de Wilton, 1st Earl of Wilton (1749-1814)] and has collected his political tracts into a volume, will send copies for Smith, William Taylor, John Taylor, and Samuel Taylor.</p><p>[Liverpool Botanic] Garden flourishes; [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden] has "collected more plants than he cou[l]d probably have done in a voyage round the world". Sorry to hear that so many of the country's finest [plant] collections are being broken up and dispersed; symptomatic of the state of the nation led by ministers who "ride it like an ass, with nails for spurs, &amp; a bludgeon for a whip".</p></abstract>
