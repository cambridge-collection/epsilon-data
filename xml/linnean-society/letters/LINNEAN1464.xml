            <abstract><p>He has taken all his examinations and taking his degree tomorrow; pleased with Leyden and friendliness of [David] van Royen [(1727-1799)] and [Frédérique Louis] Allamand [(1735-1803)], but the garden is inferior to many in England. Amsterdam garden neater, but [Nicolaas Laurens] Burman [(1734-1793)] is evasive and "shelters his ignorance under his professional dignity". Spends his mornings with Royen looking over his herbarium, his uncle's, Herman's, [Paolo] Boccone's [(1633-1704)], and Ranwolf's; 'Conium royeni' is 'Caucalis daucoides'. Royen recently resigned Leyden botanical chair, reserving use of the garden, and wanted [Carl Peter] Thunberg to succeed him, but a young man of inferior skill was appointed instead [Sebald Justinus Brugmans (1763-1819), physician and botanist].</p><p>'Eryngium campestre' and 'Menyanthes nymphioides' only worthwhile wild plants seen so far. Dismisses his dissertation "de generatione" as "an exercise &amp; a sketch". Disappointed by Amsterdam booksellers; his opinion of that town and Leyden. His future movements. Difficulty of finding Leers' "Flora".</p></abstract>
