            <abstract><p>Insists on sending Roscoe his ["Exotic Botany"] instead of him ordering it through booksellers, insisting it is not a return for copies of Roscoe's "Lorenzo" and "Leo"; relates anecdote about Sir Richard Jebb [first baronet (c 1729-1787), physician] to illustrate this. Thanks Roscoe for his concern about health of Smith's sister, Fanny [Martin], but assures him she is "naturally very strong". Responds to questions in Roscoe's previous letter concerning Captain [Thomas] Hardwicke, Mr Cooper, and [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden].</p><p>Defends his response to "the poor coxcomical "butterfly"" in the "Monthly Magazine" [criticism of Smith's "Flora Britannica"], which is to be first article in magazine next month, by reason of the same persons letter on the language of Linnaeus in 5th volume of magazine. Looking forward to receiving Roscoe's "Leo" and is enjoying [Thomas] Johnes' translation of Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler]. Hopes Roscoe will enjoy "Annals of Botany", to which he has sent a paper for the third number, due in January. Transcribes proposed title page for "Flora Graeca", in Latin, asks Roscoe's opinon. Praises maturity of James Roscoe. [William Fitt] Drake sends his compliments.</p></abstract>
