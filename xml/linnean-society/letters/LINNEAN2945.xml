            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 16 December, unfortunate timing as [Pierre Marie Auguste] Broussonet might then have travelled on the "Boston". Abbé Correa's [José Corrêa de Serra] friendship with Broussonet has caused him to be superseded in the previously promised position of public librarian, amongst other "mortifications". The emigrant Dukes of Luxembourg and Coigny took umbrage with Broussonet and applied to "the Council" to have him sent away. Explains that Portugal is under a "weak, irresolute though arbitrary" Prince [John (1767-1826) regent of Maria I, later João VI] surrounded by a "corrupt, ignorant, bigoted, intriguing court", laments confinement of Duke de Lafoens [John de Braganza, uncle of Maria I] who may have imposed some order. Is sure Mr Walpole would undertake Sir Joseph Banks recommendation in protecting Broussonet and obtaining leave for him to stay as long as convenient. However, knowing the the inconvenience he has caused Correa, Broussonet has resolved to leave for Gibraltar immediately, carrying a letter to Mr Pinto, the secretary of state; another from Mr Walpole, with his letter to General Rainsford, and the admiralty order. Anxious to hear of him, observes that "once a man's affairs get into a wrong train, it is often so difficult to set them right again". Ordered Smith's "Tour" as soon as he heard of it.</p></abstract>
