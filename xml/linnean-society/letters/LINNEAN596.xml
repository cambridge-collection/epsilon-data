            <abstract><p>Glad Smith liked his sermon; has received many compliments on it. Accepts Smith's change to wording in his paper '[Observations on the British] Fucus' and explains he decided to indefinitely express the notion that 'Fucus' are nourished solely by the surface. Does not agree with Smith over terminology used to describe capsules of '[Carex] pseudocyperus', refers to Linnaeus. Has sown the Rose of Jericho sent by Smith. Offers to have drawn the 'Dentaria bulbifera' which is about to flower in his garden. Sorry that Smith is leaving Great Marlborough Street, largely on account of its turning the Linnean Society adrift. Will enquire about a house on the Mall in Hammersmith. Remarks on formation of Greek words. Does not like [Fran√ßois] Borone's epitaph as there is "too much play on Flora" and fears the phrase "and art thou gone?" without proper cause for its introduction will be ridiculed by wits. Thinks Smith's family epitaph "beautiful" but points out several errors. Sorry that Smith's "Flora" is interrupted ["English Botany"?]. Copies out Smith's family epitaph and marks his alterations.</p></abstract>
