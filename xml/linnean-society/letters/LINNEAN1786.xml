            <abstract><p>Sending the remaining papers on Junius [pseudonym of an unknown 18th century letter writer], except the first paper addressed to Charles Butler in which he proved the non-identity of Sir Philip Francis as Junius. Godfrey Higgins will deliver his papers to Lady Francis who he thinks will maintain the claims of her husband. Asks Smith to send him any anonymous compositions of Sir Francis not generally recognised as his should he have any. Believes the memoirs of Sir Francis were written by himself. Has had correspondence with Dr William Thornton of Washington, USA, a ward of [John Coakley] Lettsom. Professor Scholefield intends to give Greek lectures. Remarks on Monk's conduct towards Smith. Pleased that Smith is near completion of 4th volume of "English Flora". Papers on Junius very well received but only privately distributed.</p></abstract>
