            <abstract><p>Has been seriously ill with extreme weakness of the eyes and disordered stomach and digestion. As his blood was so inflammatory was prescribed whey and setters water for the summer, which weakened his stomach further. About to start an infusion of 'Cinchona'. Thanks for Smith's letter of 27 June and the lichens, also recently received the other lichens sent with Mr Du Bois, pleased with 'Lichen omphalodes', 'L. fragilis', and 'L. globiferus'. Domestic news: one of his wife's brothers has caused great uneasiness; persuaded his aunts to give him another room for his study; his 'Mespilus chamaemespilus' has finally produced two fruit, which he intends for Smith; found 'Schenchzeria'; believes 'Poa retroflexa' Curtis is 'Poa distans' Linnaeus, and 'Poa salina' Pollich as determined by specimen from Ehrhart; dried 'Saxifraga hirculus', 'Schenchzeria' and 'Swertia H', 'Avena fertilis' Allioni "Auctar", suspects it 'Avena dubia' Leers; two plants of 'Lavatera punctata' just come into flower, will send seed if possible; has seed of 'Avena strigosa' Schreber "Spicilig." Retz "Obs." and 'Bromus arvensis'. His wife pregnant again.</p></abstract>
