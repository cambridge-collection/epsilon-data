            <abstract><p>Reassures Macleay he is not "indifferent" to the "sad event" of his departure [to New South Wales, Australia]; he feels the strongest regret. Delayed replying to Macleay's news until he had heard from [Robert] Brown but still waiting; thinks it not suited to his "retired manners" but if he undertakes it "with heart &amp; good will" he would be the best candidate, and would not have asked him if he did not think it did Brown honour, the Bishop [of Carlisle, Samuel Goodenough] "sometimes singular in ideas".</p><p>Third volume of his "English Flora" must be finished before he comes to London, which keeps him very busy; his "correspond[en]ts have no mercy". Feels the loss of a "real friend" in Macleay.</p></abstract>
