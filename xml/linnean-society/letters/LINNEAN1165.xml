            <abstract><p>Thanks Smith for letter and renewal of their correspondence. Delighted by Smith's description of the "real study of botany" and she often regrets that so many make botany consist of "a long catalogue of names &amp; classes, instead of directing the mind to discover the affinity plants bear to each other and their medicinal virtues", and she is convinced that people would have fewer medical complaints it they attended more to simples. Caught in storm of snow and hail on return journey from an excursion to Devil's Bridge, where building work is being carried out on a house two of her father's old servants are settled in.</p><p>They intend to stay in London for two months and she is anticipating the "charming music" she will hear at the opera and other amusements. Mr Viganoni will attend her in London so they will have "some delightful concerts".</p><p>Note by Thomas Johnes thanking Smith for his criticisms, shall write fully soon.</p></abstract>
