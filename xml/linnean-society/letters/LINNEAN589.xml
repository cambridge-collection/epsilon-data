            <abstract><p>Apologises for the trouble he has caused in trying to preempt the punctuation corrections of the typesetters [for his paper 'Observations on the British Species of Carex']. Thanks Smith for naming the genus 'Goodenia' in his honour; asks for as many specimens of species as possible. Has no "violent objection" to Smith's use of the term "Tetrathica" aside from Linnaeus' own condemnation of it; believes it and Jussieu's 'Myriothica' are innocent uses but suggests the alternatives 'Excavaria', 'Cellularia', or 'Valvaria'.</p><p>Discussion of the "defect of Louis XVI" [an apparent infertility, from his marriage to Marie Antoinette in 1770 till their first child was born in 1778, presumably for inclusion in Smith's "Sketch of a Tour on the Continent"]. Goodenough believes it was caused by an "incurvation of the penis [...] owing to an uncommon shortness &amp; rigidity of the fraenum" according to a commonly believed report from his brother-in-law who was in Paris at the time. Suggests wording for Smith's opinion of the defect, in Latin. The tooth-ache which left him "half dead" has been cured.</p></abstract>
