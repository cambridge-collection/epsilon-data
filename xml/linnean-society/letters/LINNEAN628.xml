            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 2 September. Describes charms of the neighbourhood of Boxlet, his new living. Discusses Smith's dispute with Salisbury: Salisbury's use of his sisters' names in a false manner "degrades him from the rank of gentleman"; believes Salisbury wishes he never wrote his pamphlet ["Generic characters of English Botany"] but does not know how to retract it; does not intend to read any of Salisbury's "Paradisus Londinensis"; has thought him "too wild to take a lead" since a conversation with him about Salisbury changing the nomenclature of 'Erica'; advises Smith not to enter into a squabble with Sir Joseph Banks [over his unsympathetic attitude towards to Salisbury dispute], "like all great men, he in his way is open to the tittle tattle of designing persons"; Smith should mortify Salisbury with "contemptuous silence"; blames [William George] Maton for allowing the pamphlet into the Linnean Society whilst he was in the chair.</p><p>Smith should use the verncaular form of [John] Sibthorp and [Peter Simon] Pallas in his Errata, suggests wording for an explanatory note. His aquaintance with the Bishop of Norwich [Henry Bathurst (1744-1837)]. A botanist, Mrs Brereton, is coming to Boxley. In Boxley has observed 'Hieracium umbellatum', 'Chrysosplenium oppositifolium', 'Hedypnois hieracioides', and 'Crepis biennis'. Has looked in vain in Rochester for 'Viola hirta'. Thinks 'Orchis militaris' is not a variety. [Thomas] Marsham visited after staying with [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert, deplores Lambert's weakness in dispossessing himself of his landed property by giving the inheritance to his "unworthy sisters". His own daughters are still looking for husbands, "impoverished times for such a commodity".</p></abstract>
