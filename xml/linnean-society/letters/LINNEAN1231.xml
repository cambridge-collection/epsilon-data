            <abstract><p>Hopes Smith received his last letter, in which there was "a hint respecting one of your baronets meant for your own eyes alone" [this letter is not extant in this collection]. Read [Anna Laetitia] Barbauld's "most excellent" introduction to [Samuel] Richardson's "Letters"; it is a "charming collection", but too long. Smith's "little friend" [his daughter, Marimane Johnes], to be as proficient in drawing as in music. His work on translation of Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler] keeps two compositers and one press man fully employed; third volume finished though worried White is keeping them aside as he has not seen second volume yet.</p><p>Conservatory thriving under sole management of Mrs Johnes; she received two double red and double variegated 'Camellia' from the Duchess of Bedford [Georgiana Russell (d 1853)] and asks what sort of 'Bigonia' will thrive in conservatory and best time for them. Depending on the "majorities" intends to spend this year at home finishing his book.</p></abstract>
