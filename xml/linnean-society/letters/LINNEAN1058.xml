            <abstract><p>Unable to assist Dr [George] Williams of Oxford in election as his brother's vote is the only one in his influence and he is too warmly engaged in politics to quit his post and only visits Oxford in October to attend the All Souls election.</p><p>Does not intend to visit London this year; his family's arrangements for summer. Sent his 'Confervae' drawings to [James] Sowerby but judging by his figure of 'Conferva rubra' fears he will not profit by them; lists the figure's errors in figure and requests his drawings be sent to his brother. Not usually being here at this season was unaware of the destruction of pheasant eggs by carrion crows; they also take eggs and young chickens from his poultry yard.</p></abstract>
