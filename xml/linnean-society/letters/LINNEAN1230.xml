            <abstract><p>Praises the "truly Christian goodness" of Smith's cookmaid, Mrs Cobbold, for sending presents "to those who persecuted her". Currently a bad market for all sales and now has 200 sheep and 46 head of cattle undisposed of, which will eat him out. Continuing heavy snow fall. Mrs Johnes thanks Smith for the seeds; she has now taken the conservatory and garden under her management. He has made his cook his gardener, as he did not have enough work to do, since which time he has become a "much superior cook". Mariamne [Johnes, his daughter] is very attentive to her music and drawing, and has two gardens to look after, one of which has just been ornamented with a vase Smith might have seen at [Sir Joseph] Banks' in London.</p><p>Enjoyed reading [William] Hayley's "Life of Cowper". Did not learn much from [William] Godwin's "[Life of] Chaucer" for his translation of Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler], but is saved him from attempting a "history of the manners of those times", and though he criticises Godwin's "unequal &amp; dogmatical" style believes he has "made an addition to our literature". Busy ensuring his first volume is ready for Christmas though certain of errors and unclear on how White will publish it.</p></abstract>
