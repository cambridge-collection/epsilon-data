            <abstract><p>Thanks Smith for his assistance with Charlotte [Johnes' sister, who Smith had arranged to go to India with Mrs Kindersley, a relation of Smith's]; further discussion of this. Thanks for being admitted to Linnean Society, will call in when he comes to London for Parliament._x000D_</p><p>Very uncommon weather for the season, which is more like spring than winter but with considerable rain. Despairs of peace until "some cursed event will force us to sue for it" as the French are "too much elated &amp; enraged against us [...] whether they are Monarchists, or Republicans". Anxious to get the salt tax or coasting coal duty abolished or commuted as "it would do much service" but there are "such a hoard of offices employed that no minister will ever give up such patronage". Dr [James] Anderson has a substitute for the salt tax but believes he has not included the patronage.</p></abstract>
