            <abstract><p>His travel arrangements for Bristol. Account of remainder of his time in London, including visits to Paddington to see [Thomas William] Coke and family; a ball at Mrs Bennett's, sister of [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert, where he met Sir Stamford Raffles [(1781-1826), founder of Singapore], they are now "sworn friends"; attended the King's [George IV (1762-1830)] drawing room; visited Lady Hervey and Miss Caton, Mrs Patterson unwell. Dr [Martin] Davy extravagantly applauded "English Flora".</p><p>A meeting with [Thomas] Platt [(d 1842), one of John Sibthorp's executors, supervised the publication of "Flora Graeca"], who is annoyed at the British Museum having claimed a copy of "Flora Graeca" and sued the bookseller according to the act which requires copies to be deposited with public bodies. All say he looks "remarkably well", though thinner; his night perspiration has returned. Lambert insists that they stay at Boyton, [Wiltshire], on return from Bristol as he can get them a sight of Fonthill [Abbey, Wiltshire, built by William Beckford (1760-1844), novelist]. Lady de Clifford [Sophia Southwell] said to be "breaking fast".</p></abstract>
