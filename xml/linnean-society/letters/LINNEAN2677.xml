            <abstract><p>An abscess on his right hand has delayed his reply to Smith's letter of 3 January. Has seen [Pierre Remi] Willemet's "Herbarium Mauritianum", agreeing with Smith that it is a "poor performance" and remarks that the Conway mentioned in the preface is the French commanding general in India, who may have obstructed Willemet from a political difference rather than a dislike of natural history. Attended meeting of the "Class of Natural Sciences" where it was reported that Willemet is in France and planning an expedition into the interior of Africa, and a eulogium of [John] Sibthorp by Mr de Guys was read. The only foreign botanical work of interest recently published is the "Museum Schtio-lithologicum-conense", a "splendid publication" and in English publications [Richard] Salisbury's "Prodromus", praising him as a "nebulous star". [Adam] Afzelius has brought "very extraordinary" and "truly paradoxical" plants from Africa, believes his "Flora Guineenss" will be a great step towards the improvement of botany. Has received a friendly letter from Rodrigo de Sousa [Countinho], advises Smith to write to him.</p></abstract>
