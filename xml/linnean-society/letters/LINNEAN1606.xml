            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 14 October 1783, pleased to find he is not one of "those innumerable multitude of young men who are insensible to religion &amp; virtue", as he feared, and pleased the person who had "the greatest share" in his friendship is of his religion. Pleased Smith is better, he is lucky to clear his pleurisy in Edinburgh climate._x000D_</p><p>He is assistant to Eyles Irwin [(1751-1817), Irish poet and writer], who is managing the Tinnevelly district of "the Nabob's countries", assigned to the [East India] Company for five years. Lack of integrity has hurt English name here more than anything. Insists that he has never received a bribe; effect this has on the people in knowing they can receive justice. His pay is "very handsome", and he keeps a palanquin and horse._x000D_</p><p>Describes the Tinnevelly weather and country, including floods and fires. Amused at ideas Europeans have of Indians; relates anecdote of a mutiny. Sends love to all his family, and his "charming Sally".</p></abstract>
