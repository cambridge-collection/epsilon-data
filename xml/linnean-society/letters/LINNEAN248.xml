            <abstract><p>Very busy with his official duties lately. Apologises for delay in printing of "Linnean Transactions", discusses and raises queries on [William] Roxburgh's Indian silkworms paper, due to be third paper in the new volume. Glad to learn Smith was well pleased with his Liverpool excursion, reminds Smith to pay attention to bye-laws when making out [William] Roscoe's nomination certificate for Linnean Society.</p><p>Forwarded Smith's letter to Ventenat, although doubtful of Smith obtaining books from Paris as he has no agent there, as in the last war. No doubt of Bonaparte's intention to invade, but does not believe "that there was ever an occasion on which the Country was more unanimous than it is at present", and that little issue will come of any attack.</p></abstract>
