            <abstract><p>Admires Smith's dedication to Mrs Corrie [in "A grammar of botany"]. Relieved [Thomas] Rackett received his letter on red viper. Superiority of percussion-locks. His recent health: after failing in strength for several months had a nervous seizure in July and felt low until thoroughly engaging himself in Buxton, has been assured it is not palsy and is all nervous; Buxton apothecary attributes it to neglected costiveness, Buxton doctors.</p><p>Encloses note [not extant] on corn measures. Has a profusion of peaches and nectarines; they were secured in the spring with oiled paper frames. [John] Crewe [1st Baron Crewe (1742-1829)] and party are visiting and brought green Egyptian melons for which the Horticultural Society awarded him [Frankland] the Banksian medal, but which Lord Crewe's gardener calls the Litchfield prize; supposes it has won a prize and that Lord Crewe obtained his seed from that which he [Frankland] sent the Horticultural Society in 1820 when it was new. Frankland has grown the same melon for some years so there is no contamination and the variety is kept pure.</p></abstract>
