            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 27 [March 1820]; extremely sorry for Smith's "family distress", hopes he and Lady [Pleasance] Smith will be well enough to come to London in May. His family well, though since the death of his "poor girl" in January they have had a "good deal of sickness"; more sickness in London this winter than ever known. Thinks Sir Joseph Banks has borne the winter well; Mrs [Catherine] Lambert not expected to ever recover her "reason", [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert cannot bear name of his wife to be mentioned.</p><p>"Linnean Transactions" vol 13 progressing "very slowly", conflicting opinions on presentation of [Joseph] Smith's [(1775-1857)] paper. Linnean Society's address to the King [George IV (1762-1830)] well received and printed in the "[London] Gazette". Pleased to hear that Smith is to "stick by" the original [Linnean Dining] Club; account of the division, fears consequences of break in Society's harmony which makes him more anxious than before to resign as Secretary.</p></abstract>
