            <abstract><p>Received his parents' letters of 16 May, 21 May, and 28 May [1787]. Sending books home. Sorry to hear of Molly Standard's "folly &amp; misfortune" [Smith's housekeeper; she had become pregnant]. Conduct of cousin Thomas Smith and his sister fills him with "surprise &amp; indignation [...] shame &amp; contempt". Has advised Mr Marsh to take a ship home to England, realising that he will never get well on land, and his father demands his return as he has spent over Â£600 in the last 6 months. Details of his and [William] Younge's parting of ways. "Very well pleased" with a servant he hired at Milan, though he "dresses hair badly".</p><p>During his time at Pavia met Scopoli, who having heard he intends to publish some works of Linnaeus, offered all his notes; had his suspicions about Spalanzani and Scopoli fully justified; account of Spalanzani; overlooking translation of his publication into Italian [probably his Leyden dissertation]. Time spent with the Marquis Durazzo. Suffered a slight health scare but now better.</p></abstract>
