            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's sympathies on death of his clever and resourceful daughter, [Maria]. She was attended to by Dr [Matthew] Baillie, gives an account of her final illness and death: following her recovery from an indisposition which lasted over a year a bilious attack came on which gave way to a low fever and rapid accumulation of water on the chest and in the lungs, leading to instantaneous suffocation. During the fever her pulse was only from 78 to 84. Calomel, draughts, blisters behind the ears and on the scalp, and seed water were all tried. Sir Joseph Banks very ill but thinks his strong constitution will carry him through; the moderate quantities of L'Eau medicinale he has taken have not had their usual relieving effect.</p></abstract>
