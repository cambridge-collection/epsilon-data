            <abstract><p>Last letter received from Smith dated 16 March 1795; recounts most recent letters sent and received between them, his parcel of November 1794 with seeds of 'Digitlalis' and 'Verbascum nigrum' lost on ship seized by French privateer. The war having severe impact on communications with and from Switzerland. Mandrot dead from an apoplexy. Anxious to receive continuations of "English Botany" and [James] Dickson's "Hortus Siccus Britannicus". Conscious that Smith lives "in the very centre of science" and has many correspondents and interesting observations to take up his time. Death of [Jakob] Ehrhart, one of his few Swiss connections since his poor health has made him a recluse. Named his son born 12 September Charles Edward after Linnaeus and Smith. Summarises his long unsent letter of January detailing his despair at damp which destroyed much of his herbarium.</p></abstract>
