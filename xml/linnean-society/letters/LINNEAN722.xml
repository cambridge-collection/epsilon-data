            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 14 December; clarifies that whilst he appreciates Linnean Society members with "good pockets, but no brains" he only wanted to hold up the "evil of indiscriminate admission". Discusses [Thomas] Marsham's dishonesty regarding his taking Linnean Society money and how a gift of Â£2000 from directors of West India Docks was instantly seized by creditors; doubts the Society will ever recoup its money.</p><p>Thinks that if Princess Charlotte had been of "common rank" and had a glass of the "good creature" she would have survived [Princess Charlotte (1796-1817), daughter of George IV, died 6 November 1817 of complications following childbirth]. Hopes Smith received the barrel of oysters he sent. Sorry to see [William] Hone [(1780-1842), political writer and publisher] acquitted of ridiculing "the most sacred services of the Established Church"; "well disposed people are roused to see the danger of letting the ignorant rabble loose upon the venerable orders &amp; ordinances of mankind", Goodenough expects a crisis soon.</p></abstract>
