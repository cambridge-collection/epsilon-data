            <abstract><p>No news on his regiment so his distress continues; hopeful that the detachment will be countermanded and that he will be able resign the first moment possible. Likes [Robert] Fellowe's [(1770-1847), philanthropist] book much, particulary on St Paul's epistles; has always regretted that the whole of "revealed religion was not simply confined to the four Gospels". The weather now very cold with heavy showers which is good for his turnips but not his hay. Received an excellent letter from Mr Galton mentioning Smith, will copy in his next letter.</p><p>Dr [David] Davies thinks his daughter [Mariamne Johnes] better; the tumour in her thigh has moved to under her stomach and now expects an abcess there; a young boy at Camarthen who also has curvature of the spine is to have a similar one opened today.</p></abstract>
