            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 28 [January 1796]. Account of last Linnean Society meeting: [George] Shaw disappointed him in not taking the Chair as promised, but [Richard] Salisbury filled the place and read the papers; received papers from Colonel [George] Montagu [(1753-1815)] on 2 or 3 species of birds; a motion was made for the Society to treat with Smith for purchase of the Linnaean fossil collection he intends to sell, but doubtful the funds can be found. An artist has offered to give the Society a portrait of Smith if the members subscribe to a print of it.</p><p>[Aylmer Bourke] Lambert encloses a newspaper clipping [extant], stating that Smith has retired from London on a pension "granted by his pupil the Queen"; his concerns. [James] Sowerby has obtained Smith's parcel from [Olof] Swartz.</p></abstract>
