            <abstract><p>Apologises for delay in sending lichens and can only send thirty for Davall's collection. Parcel of newspapers from [William] Este still waiting for Davall, the paper is now at an end and he is fled abroad for debt.</p><p>Asks Davall's opinion of "English Botany", which he now claims as his own and its aim "to make botany pleasing &amp; popular, so [Davall] must pardon trifling". Took more pains with "Flora Lapponica", especially the synonyms as he means to correct citation, so it requires more serious criticism. Sends [James] Dickson's third and fourth dried plant fascicules which completes the work, relieved to be free from its drudgery. Sends pamphlets on the slave trade, "a matter much talked of now". [Adam] Afzelius and Fran√ßois [Borone] have sailed [for Sierra Leone]. Sends capsule of 'Mesembryanthemum' from Cape of Good Hope, gives care instructions; a German professor has figured it as a flower under new genus 'Redeviva'. Arranging his shells. [William] Aiton [(1731-1793)] delighted with seed of 'Arenaria grandiflora'. Davall owes [James] Sowerby and Dickson money.</p></abstract>
