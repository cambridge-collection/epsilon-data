            <abstract><p>Pleased that Lord Gainsborough [Henry Noel, 6th Earl of Gainsborough (1743-1798)] has been elected [to the Linnean Society] but intended for the proposal and election to be at different meetings. The King [George III (1738-1820)] is "so far better to have grown perfectly harmless &amp; quiet, but he wavers almost every quarter of an hour" and informed that Dr [Francis] Willis [(1718-1807), physician to George III] thinks a perfect recovery will be accomplished in time with the attentions of friends. Goodenough concerned that people in the King's situation often relapse or continue with irregular waverings. The Chancellor [Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow (1731-1806)] saw the King yesterday and left convinced of necessity of immediately declaring the Regent, Goodenough convinced this likely and concludes that he understands that "the string upon which he goes off is Politicks particularly the German". Had not heard of the D of P [William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1738-1809)] declining a part in the admininstration, hopes it is not true.</p><p>Could not attend meeting on Tuesday because there was no moon for the return journey, fears his Royal Society certificate has been forgotten and asks Smith to ask Mr Greville, Mr Marsden, or Mr Blagden to sign it.</p></abstract>
