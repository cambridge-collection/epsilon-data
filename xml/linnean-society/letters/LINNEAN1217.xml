            <abstract><p>Stayed in London longer than expected for his installation as Lord Lieutenant of Cardiganshire. Congratulates Smith's family on his sister's marriage. Dined with Lady de Clifford [Sophia Southwell]; relates story of a banker who killed her Wana Ta by trying to cut off a slip of it. Hanbury Williams [Johnes' brother-in-law ?] was dying in London from a bladder and urethea complaint till his sister came to him, now recovering; Williams' family have treated them "cruelly" and by their behaviour to himself [Johnes] they have gained Â£30,000.</p><p>Asks where the Hafod views are being engraved as he would like to see a specimen before leaving London; hopes the map of the grounds will be fine, has ordered as many for Smith's 100 copies [for Smith's "A tour to Hafod, in Cardiganshire" (1810)]. Believes Edwards has transferred all the periodical publications to Evans.</p></abstract>
