            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's sympathy [on failure of his banking house]; speculates causes including the great employment of capital following the opening of the American trade and immense exports of Liverpool merchants, most of whom kept their accounts with them, although though most direct and immediate cause was from the least expected quarter [unspecified]. Confident that his and his partners' property will cover all debts and leave a disposable income for themselves and consoles himself with the thought of being freed from his many obligations. Was unaware that [Thomas William] Coke, Lord Derby [Edward Smith-Stanley], and others had been applied to. His family bear it well.</p></abstract>
