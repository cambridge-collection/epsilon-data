            <abstract><p>Congratulates Smith on his marriage, which he saw announced in the newspaper. Finds himself affected by the "dissipation of a great town" and is content just reading books on botany but honoured Smith has introduced his name into "English Botany". The Dublin Botanic Garden has begun and "liberal fine schemes are in view". The Dublin Society two years ago purchased the collections of [Nathanael Gottfried] Leske [(1751-1786) German botanist], including an herbarium, says that the Society intends to let it remain as an original work and the Society shall begin to form its own herbarium. Also collections of mineralogy, stuffed birds, shells, and insects, some with preservation issues. A man of the same name as Smith is in Ireland who spent £2000 at the Duchess of Portland's sale, asks if Smith knows him. Has noticed a volume by a Schmidt on trees, published in Vienna. Approves of Smith's opinion on Sir Thomas Brown [(1605–1682) physician and author].</p></abstract>
