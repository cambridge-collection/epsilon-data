            <abstract><p>Replies to Smith's letters of 2 October [1786] and 12 February [1787]; pleased that Smith still thinks of his Norwich friends; thanks for Bulliard [plates for "Histoire des champignons" (1791-1812)] and offer of Leers' "Flora". Comments on [Anders Jahan] Retzius' [(1742-1821)] output. Thanks for 'Gnaphalium luteo-album' and 'Agrostis minima'. Smith's access to so many famed herbariums like "taking a journey to Jupiter or Saturn". Smith's 'Senecio acanthifolius' must be "magnificent". If Smith travels through Switzerland recommends consulting [Albrecht von] Haller's [(1708-1777)] herbarium as useful for a "Flora Anglica" considering so many Swiss plants are native to England. Comments on Smith's account of his travels, including visit to [Louis] Gerard, time in Genoa with Marquis [Ippolito Durrazo], Florence, and [Lazzaro] Spallanzani's [(1729-1799), Roman Catholic priest and natural historian] disgrace, and the non-reviews of Smith's tract attacking "so great a personage".</p><p>Has not found any new cryptogamia this winter but [James] Dickson's expedition to Scotland produced 150 new species of mosses, jungermanniae, and lichens, though many were lost when [James] Crowe's portmanteau was stolen. Saw Smith's mother in Norwich who informed him of [Robert] Batty's relapse, including vomiting blood. An election declared void on account of bribery by House of Commons following petition by Sir T Beever, details of reelection. Death of his father-in-law, Mr Manning; short confinement after long decline from diabaetes.</p></abstract>
