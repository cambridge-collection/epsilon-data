            <abstract><p>Plans to bring his brother and colleague back into the new Parliament.</p><p>Certain that 'Oenanthe crocata' poisoined two of [Charles Lennox, 3rd] Duke of Richmond's [(1735-1806)] mares in foal; examined the pasture and dry streambed of the Lavant and there is evidence of the horses digging up the roots and their stomachs were full of a white substance like sawdust, agreeing exactly with what they observed on examining roots of this year mixed with decayed roots of last year; the bank of the stream is full of the plant. Noticed a horse cropping the top of the plants which he supposes is comparatively innocent and that the brood mares must have had "depraved appetites" to dig up the roots. 'Heracleum' in meadows here is called "hog-weed" and fed to the hogs. Has not found any 'Fucus' or uncommon saltmarsh plants.</p><p>[Wilson] Lowry [(1760-1824), engraver] has returned his plants and drawings unengraved after three years, offers them to [James] Sowerby.</p></abstract>
