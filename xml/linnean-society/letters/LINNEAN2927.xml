            <abstract><p>Reassures Smith that [William] Sole did not leave anything abusive towards Smith in his manuscripts [Sole took umbrage at Smith's classification of 'Mentha' in "Flora Britannica"]. Explains that Sole did not know Linnaeus' system and believed that the authority of Jean Johannes Bauhin [(1541-1613)], Caspar Bauhin [(1560-1624)], Sir John Hill [(1714-1775)], [John] Ray and others were sufficient to establish the species and Smith should consider these notes "harmless remarks of a mind cowed by disappointment". Sole's notes now in possession of a friend of Smith's, and one unknown clergyman has already been denied permission to publish them. As Smith plans to dedicate a genus to Sole relinquishes his own intentions for same, if 'Agrostis minima' is to be used suggests substituting 'minima' for another word, hopes [James] Sowerby has delinated it in the same way. Requests ['Agrostis littoralis']. Found a ['Bromus arvensis'] that corresponds exactly with the specimen in [William] Sherard's [(1659-1728)] herbarium and with [Johann Georg Daniel] Leers' [(1727-1774)] and "Scheuatzer's" descriptions, subsequently his representation will differ from that in "English Botany".</p></abstract>
