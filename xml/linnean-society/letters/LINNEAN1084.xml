            <abstract><p>Having spent last 17 of 18 springs in London he "received high gratification" from spending the last one in the country. His son has developed an interest in botany. Intercedes for [William] Travis [(1771-1851)] of Scarborough, who regrets no longer being a FLS and claims to have been struck out by a friend's blunder and is prepared to pay his arrears, vouches for him as "indefatigable in seeking improvement in his medical profession [...] and attends to every branch of natural history" and [James] Sowerby knows him as "a zealous naturalist".</p><p>His son bought a book on mineralogy by Aiken, dislikes it much and wishes there was a good manual on it. The Downton and Grange pippins of his new Herefordshire apple trees bore fruit this year; some fruit cracked, as did many of his pears. Foxley crab and Golden Harvey had fine blossom but no fruit. Siberian crab "took beautifully" on espaliers. Has started wearing flannel next to his skin as his son has done so for several years and he does not remember when he last had a cold.</p></abstract>
