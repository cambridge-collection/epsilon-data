            <abstract><p>[William Beeston] Coyte is coming to London and will visit Smith. Discusses Smith's publication plans for "Plantarum icones"; "Reliquiae rudbeckianae"; and new edition of "Philosophia Botanica", hoping that this last will be published by the Cambridge University press. Samuel Ewer of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Coyte's brother-in-law, is collecting a library of botany and will subscribe to all of Smith's works. Anger at [William] Curtis' corrections of Linnaeus. Smith's 'Centaurea [solstitialis]' has not produced any viable seed and Jonas has failed in making a successful cutting. Thanks for 'Forsythia' of Frasier which turns out to be only 'Decumaria carbara L'. Can procure Scottish plants for Smith from Dr Ramm. Would welcome [Joseph Franz ?] Jacquin to his home in the summer if Smith invites him. Coyte is to visit Westmoreland, advised to study [William] Hudson beforehand, intends to ask [James] Dickson about having him staying. Displeased from reading [Giovanni Antonio] Scopoli. Dissatisfied with [Caspar] Bauhin's [(1560-1624) Swiss botanist] "Prodrumus" and unsurprised by Linnaeus' rare use of it. Enjoyed reading "Hortus Upsaliensis" over the winter. [Charles] Sutton has a "brother botanist" at Norwich, a chaplain of the Bishop, and associates in [William] Kirby [(1759-1850) entomologist], and [Peter] Lathbury of Orford, Suffolk, [(1760-1820) rector]. [John] Pi[t]chford requires 'Equisetum sylvaticum', has a 'Carex strigosa' found last summer near Bungay, Suffolk. Asks Smith for copy of Kew catalogue. In postscript if Smith can acquire seeds of 'Epilobium latifolium' through [Joseph Franz] Jacquin and has two 'Geranium palustre' and a 'Sal. alpinum'.</p></abstract>
