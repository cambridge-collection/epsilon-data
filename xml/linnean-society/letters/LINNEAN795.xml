            <abstract><p>Offers copy of fourth volume of [Gaetano] Savi's "Botanicum Etruscum" just received from Revd Daniel Lysons [(1762-1834)]. Had not seen anything of "A.S." [Richard Salisbury] in the newspapers so Smith's account was new to him, until seeing report in the 24th October "Morning Herald" that "one of the confidential servants of the Turnham Green Cabbage Garden had decamped, after practicising a long series of frauds upon the pastoral simplicity of his employers" [Salisbury was involved with irregularities in the Horticultural Society's finances].</p><p>His sister Vernon has died, but like Sir George Baker [(1723-1809)] "easily and apparently [...] free from pain". Planning to attend Royal Society Charter Day, Horticultural Society, and Linnean Club meetings. His son and family in Paris but doubts he will see Mrs Cullum alive again, they intend to go on to Rome or Pisa.</p></abstract>
