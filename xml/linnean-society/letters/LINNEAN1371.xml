            <abstract><p>Offers to send specimens of four distinct species of 'Maranta' from Liverpool Botanic Garden, which with Jacquin's 'M. lutea' completes all he knows of the genus. Regrets cessation of "Exotic botany" not only for [James] Sowerby's "excellent" figures but for disseminating "true sound Linnean principles" at a time when they are attacked in other publications; convinced a quatro edition could be successful; Smith's "English botany" by far the "most scientific &amp; perfect Flora in any language or country" but it is ending soon and "Exotic botany" would be more worthy of Smith's skills and more widely appreciated in other countries. Offers his opinions for Smith's proposed "Illustrations of Botany" and chapter on Jussieu's system.</p><p>Agrees with Smith that events in Spain have ruined all "ideas of peace" and any effect his pamphlet might have had on the public; criticises the triumphalism of the war party; believes Napoelon might have only attacked Spain as an additional point of offence against Britain; fears the consequences, either the further extension of his despotism, or a complete revulsion in the affairs of Europe. Glad of Smith's good health; describes bad health of his sons.</p><p>Recent social events in Liverpool. [Liverpool] Botanic Garden is "flourishing" and almost out of debt so can now make a final arrangement for Smith's duplicate Linnaean herbarium.</p></abstract>
