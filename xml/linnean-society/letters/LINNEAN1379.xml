            <abstract><p>Studied mosses and lichens with Dawson Turner at Yarmouth, [Norfolk], earlier in month, Turner also relieved him from the burden of dealing with "those indefatigable writers and questioners the German naturalists". Turner to publish a book on the "Mosses of Ireland" ["Muscologiae Hibernicae spicilegium" (1804)]. Visited his wife's family in Lowestoft and Saxmundham, [both Suffolk]; discusses the country and weather; the summer has "burnt up this whole eastern country" with no rain from April till September.</p><p>Frustrations with printing of "Flora Britannica" and some "knotty points" on mosses; the difficulties with this group chiefly caused by the inaccuracies of preceeding writers; the jungermanniae and lichens will be even more variable and uncertain. The lichen from Roscoe's house is 'Lichen orostheus' of [Erik] Acharius and never observed in this country before. About to send parcel to Roscoe, including his "Tour on the Continent", [James] Sowerby's "Fungi", Paul Jovius de Piscibus, and "an imperfect copy" of Rivinus' botanical plates, which will be a useful addition to Roscoe's collection of "Icones Plantarum". Expecting visit by [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden] and has promised him a "harvest" of 'Salix'.</p><p>Asks if Roscoe's ['Crinum latifolium'] is not 'Crinum erubescens' of Redoute's "Plantes liliacees" fasc 5, as the 'C. latifolium' figured in Rudbeck and copied from ["Hortus Indicus Malabaricus"] is broader in the leaves and petals. Discusses transformation in [William Fitt] Drake's reading material and political beliefs since meeting Roscoe. Details of Roscoe's election to Linnean Society. Discusses health of Roscoe's son and inflammatory disorders.</p></abstract>
