            <abstract><p>Mild and wet winter but his health good aside from remains of rheumatism. His farm goes on, "like the nation, very flourishing"; financial issues. Anticipating arrival of "Linnean Transactions". Intends to meet [Samuel] Goodenough in London to accelerate their work of examining 'Fucus', will finish his 'Lycoperdon' paper afterwards. Requests return of his paper on 'Fucus [fastigiatus]' and 'F. farcellatus' for revision; requests loan of Linnaean 'F. farcellatus'.</p><p>Commissions London lodgings from Smith; his requirements. Intends to wait for an original edition of Leers' "Flora" as the plates in the new edition are badly copied. Discusses Sir John Rous' [1st Earl of Stradbroke (1750-1827), politician] and Lady Rous' interests in botany; John is more practical, forming large plantations with American and other forest trees, he may buy Smith's L'HÃ©ritier for his wife. Discusses Smith's forthcoming publications. Discusses specimens or figures of 'Lycoperdon coliforme' and 'Ligusticum cornubiense'; [William] Hudson's statement of knowing its habitat "a piece with the rest of his assertions"; thinks the fire was fortunate for his credit as he could not have always refused a reference to his specimens.</p><p>Urges Smith to publish his travel journal, to "convince the world that a botanist can write English intelligibly &amp; that he can give some observations beyond the names &amp; places of growth of plants".</p></abstract>
