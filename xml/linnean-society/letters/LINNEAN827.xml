            <abstract><p>His opinion of Sir Joseph Banks greatly increased following the two days he spent with him in the summer. His campaign for Cambridge botany professorship: visited Dr Davie at Bungay, [Suffolk]; he is suffering from an ulceration of the throat and will not return to Cambridge for months; gained support of Dr [William] Gretton [(1736-1813)], master of Magdalen, but he is dangerously ill; if [William] Frere [(1775-1836)] becomes vice-chancellor in November certain of gaining the garden and lectureship, does not expect difficulties attaining the professorship.</p><p>Troubled with his old, untreatable headaches. Reading Cullum's brother's [Sir John Cullum, 6th baronet (1733-1785)] "History of Hawstead"; transcribes an epithet he wrote for a musical friend. In Norwich tomorrow for the Sessions' ball and musical festival. Chiefly worked on Rees's "Cyclopaedia" this summer: wrote elaborate article on 'Passiflora' enlarged with species not in [Carl Ludwig] Willdenow. Third edition to his "Introduction to Botany" just finished printing. Message for Mr Barnwell: he has "hinted in vain for what I mentioned ab[ou]t the heart of Anne of Bretange - her funeral is very particularly described in Montfaucous' "Monarchie Francoise".</p></abstract>
