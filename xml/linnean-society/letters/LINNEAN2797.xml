            <abstract><p>Received Smith's Rome letter of 19 February. Was worried Smith was offended with him for not embracing his "scheme" [formation of Linnean Society] with same ardour as Smith and others. Confesses he feels too much ignorance when with the "ingenious and scientific" to be a part of it. Repeats remark by [Conyers Middleton (1683-1750) Church of England clergyman] that the journey to Italy is like the "the common stages and journey of life". Mentions a traveller in Sciliy who though the large 'Aloes' there were indiginous, recalls Smith's remarks and his own observations of plants on the coast being able to survive severe weather. Request from [John] Latham for Smith to acquire a good description of the "Courier" bird, described by several but seen only by Aldrovandus [Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605) Italian naturalist]. Looking forward to Smith and [William] Younge's return to London, [Samuel] Goodenough and [Thomas] Marsham are well.</p></abstract>
