            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 2 [February 1787]. Regrets not seeing their "mutual best friend", [Samuel] Goodenough, as much as he would like to; they have described about 200 new British insect species but struggle without reference to the Linnaean collections. He has not said anything of the new Society [Linnean Society] other than to [John] Lyon of Dover, [Kent], who has despaired of the present one [Society for the Promotion of Natural History] and is committed to the new.</p><p>Showed Sir Joseph Banks the section of Smith's letter concerning [Lazzaro] Spallanzani [(1729-1799), natural historian] [on dispute between Spallanzani and Giovanni Scopoli over mismanagement of the Univsersity of Pavia museum; Smith was a supporter of Scopoli]; Banks read it aloud to the gentlemen present, including [William] Hudson, L'HÃ©ritier, [Olof] Swartz, and [Jonas] Dryander. Swartz has been collecting Jamaican plants and is comparing them with Banks' West India herbarium.</p><p>Thanks Smith for obtaining some of his 'Lepidotera' desiderata; requests further species. Progress of [William] Jones figures of same; received parcel of insects from China but only contained two 'Papilio' not yet figured by Jones. Discusses [John] Latham's "Le Courent Bris" from his ["General synopsis of birds"]. [James] Dickson had a successful natural history excursion in north of Britain but all his findings were lost in wreck off Dutch coast. A valuable new entomological correspondent, and others.</p><p>Publication of [William] Curtis' "Botanical Magazine". Recent appointments, including at [Society for Promotion of Natural History] and East India Company. Wishes he could have joined Smith on his "7 golden days" in Florence; wishes he had an independent fortune of his own and thinks Smith's situation a "most enchanting one". Comments on Spallanzani and Scopoli dispute.</p></abstract>
