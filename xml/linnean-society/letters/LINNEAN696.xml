            <abstract><p>Franked Smith's letter for [John] Hawkins. Sorry to hear of the death of Smith's brother, reminds him of death of his only surviving brother when he became Bishop of Carlilse. Heard that Smith has lately had a considerable accession of fortune.</p><p>Linnean Society news: [Thomas] Marsham well again but has resigned as Treasurer of Linnean Society, replaced by [Joseph] Sabine; [Alexander] Macleay ill again; Lambert reports on Society struggles that the next volume of "Linnean Transactions" is ready but for someone to compile a list of donations for the year, and there were no papers for the last meeting nor the upcoming one. [Edward] Rudge sends compliments to Smith, reports that a Frenchman has been at Sir Joseph Banks' claiming to preserve dried meat and fish for any length of time. Goodenough has been suffering from gout since arriving in London three weeks ago.</p></abstract>
