            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 13 June but still waiting for "the handsome present", blames White [publisher] for not following his advice. Found that the best market for the serges he wanted is in Bristol; thanks Smith for his assistance. Knows little of [Thomas] Andrew Knight and does not share the same opinion "which he seems to have of himself".</p><p>Always though D'Eon "a man, &amp; that it was a gambling trick of that scoundrel de Morande to gain money by the policy", and all has now turned out as he expected. Discusses [William] Windham's [(1750-1810), politician] death and his former friendship with him; received a letter from him just before the event. Returned to Hafod first week of June but workmen still here and has no bed to offer anyone. Satisfied to find that all he planned surpasses his expectations, "both for comfort &amp; magnificance", and it is far superior to the old house.</p></abstract>
