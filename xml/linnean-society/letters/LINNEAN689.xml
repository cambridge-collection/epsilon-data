            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's medical advice, which accords with [William George] Maton and [Thomas] Copeland's [(1781-1855), surgeon]. Goodenough believes all his maladies are connected to his gout; his ankles and feet are beginning to swell again after having left off using a crutch following twelve months of suffering.</p><p>Smith should not worry about "Mr S" as "he is quite blown up &amp; I hear gone abroard" and cannot show himself in England again. A scandal involving a member of the Athenaeum; no one has been able to persuade him to make an appearance or personally deny the rumours. Had not heard of [William Jackson] Hooker's corrections of himself and Smith but not concerned. Scarcely a house in London without someone unwell.</p></abstract>
