            <abstract><p>Delighted and surprised at the "sudden unexpected blessing of Peace" [with France] and excited by possibility of accompanying Smith to Paris. [Walter] Wade will send Smith his catalogue of plants found at Connemara, Ireland. Unenthused by the idea of such expeditions. His summer botanising confined to his garden in Dublin but did find, and encloses, a specimen of 'Myosotis ÃŸ', and 'Rubus idaeus'. Comments on the unpleasant scent of 'Orchis latifolia'. Compares figures of [Philip] Miller and [William] Curtis. Found many 'Bidens' at the Bishop of Dromore's in County Down. Also found another location of 'Rubus idaeus', convincing him that it is indigenous. Asks if there is any mark to distinguish 'Nymphaea lutea' and 'Nymphaea alba' when not in flower.</p><p>Winter has been severe but believes not as much as it has been in England. Vast flocks of crossbills, 'Loxia curvirosta', stayed from the end of August till the beginning of October and wreaked havoc in the orchards. Details the course of their flight across Ireland, believes they are "good prognostics of a severe winter" having also been observed in other winters with hard frosts. Has seen in December's "Monthly Review" a "Natural History of Pennsylvania" by [Benjamin Smith] Barton. Has also seen [William] Turton's [(1762-1835), conchologist] "The Animal Kingdom" advertised. Comments on a lottery prize; biggest prizes always go to the rich. 'Eranthemum pulchellum' is in Dublin stores, a rumour that London gardeners stole it from Kew.</p></abstract>
