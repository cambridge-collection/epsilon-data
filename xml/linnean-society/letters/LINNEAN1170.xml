            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 15 [July]. In residence until end of September when he returns to his regiment. Content to stay at home and try to make his "poor neighbours happier &amp; if possible better" whilst his old schoolfriend, [William] Windham [(1750-1810), politician], whose politics have altered much since then enters "on such a stormy sea". Quotes [Jean] Froissart [(c 1337-1405), French chronicler], in French, on historical point regarding King Edward and homage paid by John, Earl Montfort, for Duchy of Brittany.</p><p>Pleased Smith has "roused such a spirit for Botany" and thinks it will have a good effect, "for whoever applies in earnest to the study of nature, must feel his heart expand". Not surprised by what Smith says of the knowledge among the "higher ranks of men in trade"; their minds are accustomed to speculation, so as their "fortune increases, that speculation is diverted to other objects", as opposed to the "country squire", a "most despicable animal".</p></abstract>
