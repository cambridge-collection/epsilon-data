            <abstract><p>Apologises for sending enclosed volumes so long after publication [probably Withering's "An arrangement of British plants" third edition].</p><p>Encloses two species of 'Arundo' of Linnaeus gathered last summer for Smith to name, always supposed them 'Arundo epigejos' and 'Arundo calamagrostis'; detailed observations on each, gives characters of his specimens.</p><p>Received specimens of 'Chizonia pulchella' recently found for first time since being found on north coast of Cornwall some years ago; differences with figure he originally made [in his "Botanic arrangement"]. Corrections to his 'Gentiana collina' figure; from new specimens received thinks it is nondescript. Thanks Smith for offer of sending proof sheets of "Flora Britannica" as they came off the press so as to correct his own work, but various circumstances means he could not profit by such. Asks after possibility of seeing Smith at Edgbaston.</p></abstract>
