            <abstract><p>Lady Cullum's cataract operation a success: performed in under five minutes with no pain and before the intense heat of June which would have complicated her recovery. Operation took place same day as Sir Joseph Banks' death, 19 June. Observations on possible 'Dianthus virgineus' grown from seed collected on Lake Garda and mentioned in last letter, it is figured in "Botanical Magazine" tab.1740. Thinks [Nathaniel Shirley] Hodson's [(fl 1800s-1830s)] botanic garden at Bury "a romantic scheme" but has subscribed two guineas and though Hodson is unqualified and "quite an amateur of flowers" he has occassionally procured curious and scarce plants.</p><p>Prior to operation Lady Cullum's eyes were treated with drops of infusion of leaves of 'Atropa belladonna', some oculists also use 'Datura stramonium' and 'Hyoscyamus'; believes [John] Ray confounded the effects of 'belladonna' and 'datura' in "Syn[opsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum] p.266", though it now turns out both dilate the pupils [Smith has annotated "Ray caused this confusion - compare ed. 2 &amp; 3"]. Did not see [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert before he left London, little hope of Mrs [Catherine] Lambert's recovery. Invites the Smiths to visit Bury in October.</p><p>Mary Cullum adds postscript, in her own hand, sending her love to the Smiths.</p></abstract>
