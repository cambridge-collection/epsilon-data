Expects Dr [David] Davies today for his daughter [Mariamne Johnes]; her blisters and general health "vastly well" but she has pains in her leg.</p><p>They now have much rain; "farmers are never satisfied". Has not yet read [Robert] Fellowe's [(1770-1847), philanthropist] book. Recommends Smith Smith read Lord Orford's [Horatio Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford (1717-1797)] correspondence; he will have "a great treat"; his opinion of them. Having just received his post finds that his regiment are preparing to embark for Ireland, but he cannot go for ten days and is much vexed.</p></abstract>
