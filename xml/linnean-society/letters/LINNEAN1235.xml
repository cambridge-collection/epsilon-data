            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter yesterday, remarks on potatoes. Heard from [Benjamin] Malkin [(1769-1842), antiquarian] that Smith's book ["A tour to Hafod" (1810)] was in a "fair way of being made publick". Discusses views and drawings of Hafod, a plan of house, drawing of the mosaic "with its proper colours", internal rearrangements he has made, an engraving of the obelisk he erected to the late [Francis Russell, 5th] Duke of Bedford [(1765-1802)], has no drawing of the "charming chain bridge" on a new walk he has made.</p><p>They are all in good health except for [Hanbury] Williams [his brother-in-law], who seems "on the decline", though "if he would not give such way to his grief" [following death of his wife and Johnes' sister, Elizabeth] he would "last some time". Delightful weather and fine foliage, though the "urns of my river gods are almost dry".</p></abstract>
