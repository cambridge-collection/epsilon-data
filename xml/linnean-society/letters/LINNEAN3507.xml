            <abstract><p>He has little botanical news, his lectures taking up too much of his time. His "Flora Britannica" and also a "Florula" of New Holland are going on well. Believes [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert has provided Pulteney with a sketch of his 'Proteacea', overseen by Sir Joseph Banks and [Jonas] Dryander: order of 'Rutacea' numerous and difficult; 'Dicandria Papilionacea' most troublesome of all; 'Pultenaea' stands firm. He has been "addicted" to butterflies recently; in a few days a "splendid" work on "the rarer lepidopterous insects of Georgia" is to appear, including new plants not figured in "Hortus Kewensis".</p><p>Invites Pulteney to Norfolk to see the Linnaean shells, reassures him that none "strayed" whilst they were being organised. About to publish a volume of miscellaneous natural history papers. [Adam] Afzelius and [Archibald] Menzies are preparing accounts of their travels. Staying here till 25 May.</p></abstract>
