            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 8 [September 1786]. Recovering from a sprained ankle. Gratified by Smith's attention to "the New Society" [Linnean Society], but wishes to continue in the old Society [Society for the Promotion of Natural History] until at least their Anniversary meeting, as he is one of the Presidents until that time; will ensure Smith is not elected one. Unable to see Sir Joseph Banks until November.</p><p>Pleased to hear of Smith's intended trip to Italy; laments the loss of his Latin and inability to speak French, hopes to rectify this one day. Received samples of [Thomas] Martyn's projected work on insects ["The English entomologist" (1792)], on which he has offered his assistance; as Martyn is not an entomologist and will not be describing insects it will not affect his own projected work ["Entomologia Britannica" (1802)]. Requests a good print of Linnaeus. Requests any new edition of [Giovanni] Scopoli's work. Would like to see Smith's interview with [Lazzaro] Spallanzani's [(1729-1799), natural historian] following publication of his treatise [Smith's translation of Linnaeus' "A dissertation on the sexes of plantson dispute" (1786)]. Death of [Henry] Smeathman [(1742-1786), explorer and entomologist] of a putrid fever. Requests specimens of English 'Lepidoptera'.</p></abstract>
