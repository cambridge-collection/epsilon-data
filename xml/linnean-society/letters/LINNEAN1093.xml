            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 30 [August] enclosing his son's sketch of 'Lepas anatifera'; was not aware of such an accumulation of shells but should have known at first sight and happy to hear of his son's short interview with Smith. His son and daughter-in-law have a 9 month old daughter, latter "makes herself mistress of whatever subject she undertakes by reading &amp; retaining all"; she makes out botany genera "with great acuteness" and his son shapes his pursuits to hers and the garden benefiting from their attention to it.</p><p>Pest control: plagued with wasps this summer and they tried destroying every nest and also hung 100 opodeldoe phials baited with treacle, but the most effective solution were small Scotch gauze landing nets with an iron wire bow held under attacked fruit and gently shaken, sketch in ink of trap. Flies now attacking semi-ripe nectarines. 'Hoya' and yew berries do not attract wasps. Scotch gauze bags do not protect grapes but foundation muslin bags do, and saved many large moonpark apricots by covering each with tow which in addition equalises heat and ripens the fruit more perfectly.</p><p>Exotic seeds and plants: his recent exchange of correspondence with [Sir Joseph] Banks after sending Banks seeds from Lima, [Peru], sent by his nephew, Commodore Bowles, including 'Araucaria imbricata' which is described "as growing as high as St Paul's". Sowed seeds received from his vicar's married sister in Bombay: 'Poinciana pulcherrima' (Geal Mohr), 'Ipomoea quamoclit' (Chinese creeper), 'Annona squamosa' (custard apple), Blue convoloulus his gardener thinks 'Dolichos', and 'Abrus precatorius' as scarlet pea. Also sent from Lima: many air plants but only one is alive, at Southampton Botanical Garden, and it is just flowering; received five seeds of 'Annona tripetala' and raised three, gave other two to Banks who intends to send them to Malta; Circassian beads ('Adenanthera pavonia') and both 'Ipomoea' came in last parcel, Banks ascertained species in difficult cases; the seeds were collected by [Aim√© Jacques Alexandre] Bonpland [(1773-1858)]; raised amongst the Lima plants 'Apocynum androsaemifolium'.</p></abstract>
