            <abstract><p>Thanks for the Smiths congratulations on a family wedding [possibly his son]; sorry that a boil on Smith's shin with erysipelatous appearances kept him at home. Surprised by death of Alexander Aubert [(1730-1805), astronomer and businessman]. Sir Thomas Gage has moved from Bury to Portman Square, London, and has seen Sir Joseph Banks, [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert, and [William George] Maton, who sat in Linnean Society chair.</p><p>Has only seen first two numbers of [Richard] Salisbury's "Paradisus [Londinensis]". An 'Alea alle' was taken at Herringfleet, [Suffolk], nine inches in length and weighing four ounces, thinks [Thomas] Pennant's "British Zoology" plate 82 made the bill too sharp and omitted the white spot on upper eye lid.</p><p>Heard of Smith's good health from Dawson Turner. Received wild specimens of 'Draba aizoides' from from [Lewis Weston] Dillwyn [(1778-1855)]. 'Ophrys monorchis' and '[Ophrys] spiralis' in abundance this summer and autumn; 'Cuscula epithymum' withered on 'Erica' but in full flower in shady places on 'Lotus corniculatus' 28 Sep; 'Genesta filosa' which begins to flower about 20 May for a month regularly flowers again in September, from when he has specimens; suspects a 'Verbascum' growing in lane near his house is from a garden, answers except in colour to 'Verbascum phaeniceum' in Murray's "Syst[em of] Vegetable[s]". Compliments [William Fitt] Drake and wishes his eyes were sharp enough to find plants such as 'Lathraea squamaria', which he has not seen since leaving Bath sixteen years ago. Presumes [Dawson] Turner and [William] Kirby must have keen eyesight. Frost has stopped the 'Verbascum' flowering, encloses specimen.</p></abstract>
