            <abstract><p>Proceeded by extract from the "Edinburgh Review", pointing out errors in Smith's synonyms [in "Flora Britannica"?]. Visited the Maurice; their daughter found a pine stag beetle, first time of it being found in that neighbourhood, thinks the larva may have been brought there from Hampshire; she has seen a beautiful, lively, opaque grass-green beetle with a yellow spot on each wing. If what the "Annual Review" speaks of tours being in as much request as novels is true, Smith ought to make much of his "Lapland Journey" ["Lachesis Lapponica"]. Urges Smith to read review of "Flora Britannica" in the "Annual Review" and what, "in the name of your fair country women", they advise him to do; alarmed to learn what a name Smith has for "gallantry".</p><p>Her father wrote a response to Mr Everett's pamphlet [attacking Mr Reeve's "overgrown power" as steward of Manor of Lowestoft] against himself but decided not to publish; transcribes an extract. A regiment of Fifeshire militia men posted at Lowestoft, the "soberest soldiers ever known", who instead of getting drunk club together to hire books to read.</p><p>[Note in Smith's hand] discusses obtaining drawing of 'Nymphae' from [James] Sowerby.</p></abstract>
