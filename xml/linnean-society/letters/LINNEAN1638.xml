            <abstract><p>Sent on 23 [July 1787]. Received his father's letter of 2 July [1787], sorry his letter of 8 June [1787] took so long in reaching Norwich. His reasons for extending his stay in Genoa. Forced to buy himself a new outfit at Genoa. Lists all the sums of money he has taken since leaving Paris. Pleasure of travelling with [William] Younge. Responds to points in his father's letter regarding his travels. Has met Mr Caffarena, who reports that England is in danger of a war from "the folly of our booby King [George III (1738-1820)]; Mr [William] Pitt [(1759-1806), prime minister 1783-1801] will be very popular for his conduct"; hopes the King will not be able to do without him. His time with the Marquis Durazzo. Dreams of his future house being a place of relaxation for his parents.</p></abstract>
