            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 11 [June]. His enjoyment of this house; "it is really the nicest cradle for old age" and intends to spend winter here. Shortly returning to Hafod, [Cardiganshire]. Asks Smith to order "empyreumatic lignious acid" for him; anxious to try it on flesh and fish. Asks if Smith has seen Slater's "steam kitchen", "one of the cleverest and most useful inventions". Looking forward to Smth and [Thomas William] Coke's visit to Hafod; his high opinion of Coke. Smith's opinion that we may be near the end of the French Revolution is "very just", though not as near as the ministers think; French politics.</p><p>Confirms that it was his friend Merivale who wrote the verses for Miss [Mariamne] Johnes' epitaph [his daughter]; Merivale's character and other work. Dreads the effect of her memorial, to be erected shortly.</p></abstract>
