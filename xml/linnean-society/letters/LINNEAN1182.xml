            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 21 [January]. Waiting to see Smith to fully explain his personal affairs; found that when "money comes into competition with [...] friendship the last vanishes away like an airy vision".</p><p>Suggests contents for Smith's proposed "short Tour" of his part of Wales, "which are hitherto maiden", for it to be published by Edwards will publish and for it to include "beautiful" drawings of his own and of Colonel Greville's, which alongside Smith's writing will "answer for the sale being very great".</p><p>They have had fine weather but very great storms of wind, rain, and thunder; many of his sheep killed by lightning. Introduced "capital improvements" in the economy of forcing plants and fruit in his garden.</p></abstract>
