            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 20 January [1797]; pleased to hear of Smith's successful move from Hammersmith, [Middlesex], to Norwich, [Norfolk]. Had a letter from [Samuel] Goodenough expressing his regret at Smith's removal from London and fears of it being injurious to the Linnean Society; he himself fears Smith's "uninterrupted literary leisure" at Norwich will prevent his visits to London being as frequent as the wellbeing of the Society requires. Plans for their visit to the Smiths in Norwich.</p><p>Glad to hear of hopes of favourable outcome for [Mariamne] Johnes' lameness. There is no "greater plague than the fancied discoveries of young botanists", in reference to "minute" specimens sent by Dawson Turner of several marine plants. Writer in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for December [1796] has proposed arranging 'Fucus' with the zoophytes; in response states that 'Fucus' are "really &amp; truly vegetables, producing seeds", and [John] Stackhouse is currently engaged in experiment of raising the larger sort from seed, and expects to succeed.</p><p>Glad Smith likes [William] Withering's new edition [of "An arrangement of British plants"]; Withering is indebted to Smith and others for the improvements; Withering's "true spirit of candour". Surprised by Smith's objection to the alteration of the system; had idea that Smith entirely approved [Carl Peter] Thunberg's system and that he intended to adopt it for his "Flora [Britannica]". Curious to see [Archibald] Menzies', not [Adam] Afzelius', 'Fucus' specimens, one appears similar to his 'Ulva decorticata'.</p></abstract>
