            <abstract><p>Recovering from a three week long bout of gout. Received letter from Mr Lynn [Goodenough's son-in-law] stating that the possessor of a disputed estate in the manor of Kirkland, Cumberland, proved at court his right and title to it, so that Mrs Stoddart has had to stop her action [in attempt to claim fees and dues owed to the manor, see RelatedMaterial]. [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert appears to have recovered from his intense agitation. [Alexander] MacLeay has returned to town looking pale and thin. Happy but uncertain how stable the peace with America will prove [War of 1812, North American conflict between Britain and Ameria, 1812-1815]. "The world seems tired out with war &amp; strife [...] but France [...] is like the troubled sea, which is never at rest". Sir Joseph Banks "remarkably well". Asks when the fourth volume of "Flora Britannica" is out.</p></abstract>
