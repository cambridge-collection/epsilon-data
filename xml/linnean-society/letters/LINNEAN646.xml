            <abstract><p>Forwarded Smith's letter to [George] Don and believes Don will be satisfied with Smith's conciliatory manner and correct his mode of publication, which is symptomatic of a general surplus of natural history publications: "everyone [is] publishing, quite to the nausea of purchasers, the commonest things - when [George] Shaw [(1751-1813), naturalist] published the cock-sparrow &amp; the common snail, I thought it high time to discontinue the Nat[urali]st's Miscellany". Don's discoveries are very valuable; the 'Hypericum' and 'Equisetum' were new to him. Believes others have been more devious than Don has been in attempting to naturalise foreign plants; cites example of Laurents and himself sowing 'Sisymbrium polyceratium' in the streets of Bury [in reference to claims by James Donn of Cambridge Botanic Garden that Don had used Cambridge seeds to grow and then claim as plants indigenous to Scotland, see RelatedMaterial]. Thinks Don's 'Lamium' a distinct species especially if the leaves are constantly petriolated.</p><p>Hugh Davies sent him his three species of articulated 'Juncus' but one had no leaves to it [see RelatedMaterial below]. Remembers the 'Sempervivum sediforme' at Kew and contending with [William] Aiton [(1731-1793), gardener at Kew] that it was 'Sedum', Aiton convinced it was 'Sempervivum' on [Daniel] Solander's authority. Pleased by Smith's proficiency in Greek and with Dioscorides, recommends Theophrastus and Bodaeus' notes. Sorry to see that "envious creature [Richard Salisbury] again barking at you" and reaffirms that Smith is the "King of Nat[ural] History". Was not aware that Dr [John] Hull [(1761-1843), physician and botanist] was of such a "predatory turn". Eager to see "Flora Britannica" complete but glad to find "Florae Graecae Prodromus" progressing so well.</p></abstract>
