            <abstract><p>Sends twenty-third and twenty-fourth numbers of "Exotic Botany", completing the work; expects no further numbers. Sends specimens of 'Ophrys corallorhiza' gathered last summer near Edinburgh by Edward John Maughan [(1790-1863), civil servant], he also found 'Buxbaumia aphylla'. The 'Ophrys' is growing in his garden and about to flower, the root smells of 'Epidendrum vanilla'. Sends collection of franks for Sir Thomas Heselrige, including one of [William] Roscoe's. Roscoe's recent pamphlet recommending peace; as his opposition to the slave trade led him to be called a deist expects him to be called an atheist for this one; first edition sold out in several days; the abuse the ministerial papers give it shows their "dread &amp; respect" of it.</p><p>Linnean Society well attended but has a lack of papers, he is supplying papers on germination of seeds and British 'Hieracium', with more to follow; it is the way he best likes to merit his situation in the Society. His "Introduction [to Botany"] seems "much liked", hopes it will be useful. Second fasciculus of "Flora Graeca", all the grasses, soon appearing; the sequel of "Flora Britannica" to be his "leading object". Rejoices at [Samuel] Goodenough's elevation [to Bishop of Carlisle]. [James] Crowe's careless will has set all his family at odds.</p></abstract>
