            <abstract><p>Glad to hear that Smith attended the musical festival at Norwich. Does not think Mr Alexander's hurried advice could have done Smith's eye much benefit. Lady Cullum visited Mrs [Catherine] Lambert in London, she is confined to bed having lost the use of one side of her body and [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert is in Wiltshire and attended the annual meeting of "literati" at Sir [Richard] Colt Hoare's. Attended Horticultural Society meeting; there were numerous apples and pears and a "magnificent" number of species and varietites of 'Dahlia', and in Covent Garden market Coe's plum or the golden drop are selling three shillings a dozen. London weather prevented him from going to the Chiswick garden. [John] Latham publishing an index to his "General History of Birds". Bishop of Carlisle [Samuel Goodenough's] death gave him much cause for concern, and shocked at how few members of the Linnean Society from 1788 and 1789 are still alive.</p><p>In footnote Mary Cullum sends her good wishes to the Smiths.</p></abstract>
