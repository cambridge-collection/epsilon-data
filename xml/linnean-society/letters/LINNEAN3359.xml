            <abstract><p>Believes his letter to Smith of July 1798 and parcel to Sir Joseph Banks have been lost, contents included: latest parts of "Acta" [of Swedish Academy of Scienes], including Smith's paper on 'Westringia'; copies of Smith's dissertation on 'Plukenetia' from "Acta Soc. Upsaliens" vol 6; and a paper of his in same volume on 'Epindendrium'. Hope Smith received the West Indies plants and cryptogamic plants sent with his letter of October [1798]. Sends paper on 'Ehrharta' for "Linnean Transactions", further notes on it. Informed by [Adam] Afzelius that Smith is finishing "Flora Britannica". The printing of his "Flora Indiae occidentalis" has been delayed by the war. Has attended to ['Anthesteria'] in a similar way to 'Ehrharta'. Asks Smith's opinion of his work on 'Epidendrum', further notes on it.</p><p>Long postscript discussing specimens of a New Holland genus in the 'Gynandria' class Smith sent him in 1795 and provisionally named "nov genus orchidearum no 2", believes it is of the genus 'Orchid.' and has written on it in the "new journal of botany" published by [Heinrich Adolph] Schrader in Gottingen. Queries plants in Smith's "Tentamen botanicum de filicum generibus dorsiferarum", including: 'Onoclea', 'Osmunda spicant', 'Acrostichum septentrionale', and 'Davallia falcata'. Has two new species for 'Villaria', they are published in second volume of "Neue Schriften des Gesellschaft Naturforschende freunde in Berlin". Has been working for a long time on the 'Gynandrous' genera and order 'Orchid.', confident of finding a firm character.</p></abstract>
