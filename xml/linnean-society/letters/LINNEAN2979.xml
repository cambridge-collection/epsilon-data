            <abstract><p>Thanks for promise of specimen of 'Trapa natans'. Has sent specimens of the "Lambert nut" in all its stages to [James] Sowerby for possible inclusion in "Exotic Botany". Received from Gaertner first part of his "continuation of the Carpology". Received letters from [William] Roxburgh who has plenty of work [for Lambert] with his Flora although his herbarium is very small. Roxburgh having difficulties finding a house big enough for his large family. [George] Jackson saw "our worthy friend" [probably Richard Salisbury] looking for seeds of 'Convolvulus' and saying Smith was mistaken about them. Intends to ask Salisbury when he intends to publish new edition of his "Paradise Lost" ["Paradisus Londinensis"]. An unnamed "certain person" whose affair with Forster and Lambert deserves him "to be hurt". Would like Smith's opinion of [William George] Maton's new work ["A general view of the writings of Linnaeus"], reviewed by Thornton in the "Monthly Epitome".</p></abstract>
