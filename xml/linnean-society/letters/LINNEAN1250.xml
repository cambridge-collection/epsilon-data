            <abstract><p>Previously sceptical of the fiorin grass called 'Agrostis stolonifera', or couch, but now convinced on its excellent qualities and on encouragement of Dr Richardson and Mr Miller set to convert his "dreary moors" to "the finest hay grounds". He is also improving a new farm which was only Â£20 rent, expecting in a few years for it to be worth hundreds, independent of the trees; he shall be "a better compatriot than either Pall Mall or Manchester Square [both in London] can boast of". Comments on an event that was a "total dereliction of principle &amp; of all honourable feeling" and is very sorry for his country.</p><p>Has known [Thomas William] Coke since childhood at Eton [College, Berkshire], but ashamed to have never taken up any of his many invitations to Holkham, [Norfolk]. Struggling to catalogue his books. The weather is "miserably wet". Does not think his wife will ever regain her spirits to enjoy company.</p></abstract>
