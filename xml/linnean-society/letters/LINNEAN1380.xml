            <abstract><p>Replies to Roscoe's letter of 21 April. At Sir William and Lady East's, amidst "vast avenues of limes, beech woods, abounding with rare 'Orchideae', &amp; a most beautiful surrounding country" to escape London; searching for 'Monotropa hypopitys' in woods near Bisham Abbey, comments on history of that place. Thanks for Roscoe's kindness to his friend John Fraser [(c 1750-1811), botanist], although Fraser did not give the 'Cryptogamic' plant Roscoe sent with him. Recently sent packet of seeds to [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden]. Anxious about his brother-in-law, Mr Martin, but not in despair.</p><p>Presumes Roscoe's proposed botanic paper will be about natural systems, particularly Jussieu's. Recently received letter from Jussieu, a "very worthy amiable character", though he called the Linnaean system "l√©ze nature". The fashion in the "Banksian circle" is to sneer at Jussieu, [Richard] Salisbury goes but is in much less esteem than he was.</p><p>Has just published his "Hafod tour", limited to 100 copies. Has undertaken to finish a "Flora of Britain" in English as soon as possible, to cover the first 23 classes, with a possible separate Cryptogamic volume when "Flora Britannica" is finished. Also contemplating his long projected work on garden plants. New edition of "Hortus Kewensis" printing, Roscoe is "copied implicitly &amp; avowedly" on 'Scitamineae'. Hopes Roscoe agrees with him on spelling of "Linnaeus", for which he cites last "Monthly Magazines", Jussieu, and the French writers. Saw Mr Currie in London.</p></abstract>
