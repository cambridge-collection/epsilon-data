            <abstract><p>Wishes some notice to be paid to [Richard] Taylor [(1781-1858), printer and naturalist] as a return for his "gratuitous assistance as Secretary". Has informed [John Russell, 6th] Duke of Bedford that he can be admitted to Linnean Society at his leisure after paying the fee. Happy to hear [Thomas] Marsham as taking the "best method to silence "curious tongues"".</p><p>Account of his improved health, though he is still weak; arranged for Bishop of Carlisle [Samuel Goodenough] to preside at anniversary meeting, impossible for him to attend for fear of journeys such as those in 1802 and 1812 which affected his health so much, his current illness also caused by journey from London. If Marsham pays all he owes by 24 [May 1816] "some civil notice of him should be taken", otherwise "silence will be most prudent".</p></abstract>
