            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter received yesterday; forwarded its enclosed letter to Dublin. Glad Smith likes the second volume of his Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler] translation; the "British critic has used me handsomely, the Edinburgh very well, but has shown great ignorance". White [publisher] has the third volume and will have the fourth in May. Blasts those he thought his friends; in future shall "keep the world at a distance". Discusses his planned transations of other French chroniclers: [Jean de] Joinville [(1224-1317)] and [Enguerrand de] Monstrelet [(1400-1453)]. Will be happy to see Smith and Mrs [Pleasance] Smith in August.</p><p>Asks in which book they can find a 'Volkameria', a "beautiful cocinea spiry plant", which he has but unable to find in any of his books, would be grateful to Smith for any seeds. His conservatory and garden prospering, especially since making his cook also his gardener. [William] Roscoe's severe fit of gout is delaying his "[Life and Pontificate of] Leo X". Praises drawing skills of Mariamne [Johnes, his daughter]; he thinks her copies of the etchings in Spencer's "Leonora" are equal to the originals.</p></abstract>
