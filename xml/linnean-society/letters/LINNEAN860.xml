            <abstract><p>Missed Linnean dinner but concludes [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert, [William George] Maton, Edward Forster, [William Horton] Lloyd, [Alexander] Macleay, and [Joseph] Sabine attended. Pities [Thomas] Marsham, though he has behaved so badly that his friends "cannot palliate his behaviour", and understands that Bishop of Carlisle [Samuel Goodenough] is particulaly upset [after Marsham stole funds from the Linnean Society]. Sir Joseph Banks in good health. Attended Linnean Club meeting at British Coffee House, Maton in chair as Lambert unfit to attend, Sabine, Macleay, Forster, [Robert] Brown, [William] Pilkington [(1758-1848)], and [William] Smith attended.</p><p>Met Sir Christopher Pegge [(1765-1822)], Oxford professor of anatomy, at Hunterian Museum, he has moved to Upper Grosvenor Street. Frequently sees Dr [William] Webb, Master of Clare Hall. Has not seen Dr [John] Haviland [(1785-1851)], Sir Isaac Pennington's [(1745-1817)] successor [as Cambridge Regius professor of Physic], but thinks him influential for Smith's Cambridge prospects. Duke of Bedford's [John Russell, 6th Duke] "handsome present" to Smith [copy of "Hortus Gramineus Woburnensis"], having consulted Sir Humphry Davy's copy thinks the work "truly worthy of a Duke of Bedford".</p><p>Recently stayed with Dr Martineau. Asks if Smith has seen Revd and Mrs Ward, who sent the East India seeds sent on to Lambert for distribution. Bought fourth part of Smith's "Prodromous florae Graecae" and Arabella Rowden's [(1774-1840)] "Poetical Introduction to the Study of Botany", would like to know what is the plant 'Brusenia' she gives as an example of 'Polyandria decagynia' in the latter [Smith has annotated "'Brasenia' Schreb. Gen. p.372"]. Transcribes, in Latin, a reference found in records of the monastery at Bury St Edmunds requesting a herb called "scathery" for the monks to eat with their beans; asks if this was ever a name for parsley.</p></abstract>
