            <abstract><p>Succeeded in gaining his son's support [Edmund Goodenough (1785-1845), headmaster and dean of Wells] for Dr [George] Williams at Oxford, although from his son's note and Smith's letter unsure "what this place of physical contention is" [possibly a disagreement over the Aldrichian chair of anatomy and physiology, founded 1803].</p><p>Apologises for missing Linnean Society anniversary meeting; [Thomas] Marsham rescinded his offer of accommodation and it is otherwise too difficult finding a place to stay in London. Also surprised at the expensive dinner tickets which he believes will "frighten away most of the valuable members" such as [John] Fairbairn, [Thomas] Hoy [(c 1750-1822)], [Jonas] Dryander, and [James] Dickson; compares prices with Westminster School and Orphan School dinners. Observed his first rare plant in Rochester, 'Ophrys nidus-avis', at the side of a wood. Is not confident of Rochester's suitability for botanising; the hills mean there is very little rain. Asks when the remaining part of ["Flora Britannica"] appears; fears [Napoleon] Buonaparte will invade before it does. Gives his regards to [Aylmer Bourke] and Mrs [Catherine] Lambert.</p></abstract>
