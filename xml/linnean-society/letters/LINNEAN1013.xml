            <abstract><p>Sorry to receive account of Smith's ill health. Made herself ill after staying at her house in Stratton Street, [London], and visiting the ill Mrs [Elizabeth] Weddell, who was much better and more composed than she expected. Hopes Smith enjoys his trip to Matlock, [Derbyshire], and [Richard] Salisbury.</p><p>Wishes Smith had sent a name for her 'Geranium', the seeds came from Captain Rhio via [Harvey] Spragg. Received Botany Bay seeds from Lady [Amelia] Hume and additional seeds from Governor [Arthur] Phillip [(1738-1814), first governer of New South Wales] via John King and [Sir Joseph] Banks; they were packed very badly. Asks if [John] White [(1757-1832), surgeon in New South Wales] is returning to England. Asks Smith to look again for drawing of Lord Charlemont's Room and the Epitaph she sent him. Smith can keep the Voltaire volumes for longer and she will read the sermons Smith speaks of if he leaves them at her London house.</p></abstract>
