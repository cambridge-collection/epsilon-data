            <abstract><p>[Robert] Brown has declined the Linnean Society Secretaryship; it would be a waste of his "great talents". Unsurpised that [Alexander] Macleay should think the Secretaryship undervalued as he made himself President whilst the position by ordering councils without consulting any of the vice-presidents, contrary to the charter. Glad that Smith approves of [James] Bicheno.</p><p>Sorry to hear of Smith's loss in India but forwarded his letter to [William] Roscoe; worries about his friends in Madras, where the has been bad cholera. Sir Thomas Raffles [(1781-1826), founder of Singapore] is fitting up Sir Humphry Davy's house to make a large display of natural history specimens. There are many candidates for Linnean Society membership though unsure whether or not they are practical naturalists; has always feared an influx of unscientific persons. Has a "sort of dread" of the Horticultural Society.</p></abstract>
