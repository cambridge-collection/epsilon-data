            <abstract><p>Account of the dinner at Somerset House [home of the Royal Academy] at which the Prince Regent [George IV (1762-1830)] was present and made a speech in which he pledged himself to support the arts, and in which he praised the exhibition and artists, including [Benjamin] West [(1738-1820), painter and president of the Royal Academy 1806-1820]; West's speech kept them in "agony".</p><p>His first two lectures "more splendidly &amp; fully attended" than any he ever had; they are held on Mondays and Tuesdays. London meetings. Consulted by Mrs J Lane about an abridgement of Gibbon she has in hand. Wearing mourning for T Smith; surprise at suddenness of Leyson Cooper's death. [William] Roscoe may be coming to the Installation and to Holkham, [Norfolk]. Bishop of Durham [Shute Barrington] to become Honorary Member of the Linnean Society.</p></abstract>
