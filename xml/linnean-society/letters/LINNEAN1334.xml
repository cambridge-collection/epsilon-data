            <abstract><p>Has been waiting for Roscoe's 'Sciatamineae' paper so he can proceed with plants from that family in "Exotic botany". His leg still healing but is much better.</p><p>Indignant at a critical review of Roscoe's book ["Life and Pontificate of Leo the Tenth"]; [William Fitt] Drake's theory as to the author. Fears imminent second edition of his "[Sketch of a ] tour [of the continent]" will be similarly treated. Gives his complimentary opinion of "Leo", though agrees with "country gentlemen" in wishing for a translation of the poetry and quotations and questions use of English in another section.</p><p>Sir Joseph Banks has offered to mediate between himself and [Richard] Salisbury, who initially thought Smith was being too severe until further explanation. Received another "most abusive &amp; rascally" letter from Salisbury offering to resign vice-presidentship and detailing illegal property. [William] Salisbury [(d 1823/1829)], the nurseryman, says his name is ruined for Â£500 a year as people assume he belongs to the Yorkshire [Richard] Salisbury and will not deal with him.</p></abstract>
