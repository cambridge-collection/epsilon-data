            <abstract><p>Reviewed first volume of "Linnean Transactions" with [Thomas] Woodward, their opinions: Woodward thought it very thin but Cullum would be happy to see annual production of similar sized volume; [Espirit] Giorna's paper on insect wings should have been translated; [Adam] Afzelius' paper on 'Trifolium' "tedious"; wonders what the Society in Warwick Street [Society for the Promotion of Natural History ?] think of it.</p><p>'Colchium autumnale' now in flower, transcribes Latin observations on it made by a near relation of his in 1773. Suggests travel arrangements for Smith to reach his house in Suffolk, hopes Smith will return the many visits he paid Smith in Marlborough Street. Publications: asks after Hoffmann's "botanical pocket book" he has seen advertised; when "Flora Lapponica" is to be published; and if there is any thought of a new "Species plantarum". Asks Smith to pay his bill to [James] Sowerby for him.</p></abstract>
