            <abstract><p>Pleased to hear that Smith is recovering from his fever with medicines and sea air but asks why, given his propensity for fevers, he has not found a preemptive remedy to be applied at the first signs of one. An abundant harvest expected in Cumberland. Has used his entomological knowledge to cure his farmer's fears timing when to bring in the hay after observing that any approach of rain brings out insects such as 'Tabanus pluralis'. Enquires after the fourth volume of "Flora Britannica". His given his son, Edmund, Smith's "Introduction to Botany". Glad that Smith is to finish settling the Linnean Society's business with the Prince Regent. It never rains all day in his part of the country. Takes it for granted that America will have to be classed as an enemy but hopes peace will be preserved [War of 1812, fought between Britain and USA over British interests in North America, 1812-1815].</p></abstract>
