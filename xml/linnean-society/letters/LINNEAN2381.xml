            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 16 [July 1792] and books; congratulates Smith on return of his health; state of his account with Smith. Expects he will have to draw a line soon regarding his purchase of works on exotic botany. Book orders for himself and a gentleman of his neighbourhood.</p><p>Should his 'Lycoperdon' paper be intended for publication he has some small additions to make. [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert in a "very low &amp; depressed state". Grandmaison has published a French edition of his "View of the Writings of Linnaeus". Cannot come to London to examine Linnaean shells; his own collection contains nearly 1000 distinct species; he has lately inspired two young gentleman of the area in natural history, including [William George] Maton, whom Smith has already shown the Linnaean shells. Hears much of Bulliard's book on fungus ["Histoire des champignons de la France.." (1791-1812)].</p></abstract>
