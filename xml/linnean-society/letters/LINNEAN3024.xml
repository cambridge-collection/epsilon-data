            <abstract><p>Thanks for turkey. Received letter from [Michel Felix] Dunal [(1789-1856) French botanist] on seeds and specimens for his work on 'Solanum'. Received letters and specimens from unknown doctors in New York. Received letter from [Thomas] Nuttall [(1786-1859)] in Charlestown, USA. [Sir Stamford] Raffles [(1781-1826)], late governor of Java, in London, "quite the lion of naturalists" has brought back vast collections, Raffles' house in Bernes Street "is quite a museum", his collector Dr [Thomas] Horsfield [(1773-1859)] is still in Java. The Duchess of Somerset requested an introduction to Raffles from Lambert for the Duke [Edward Adolphus Seymour] and herself to see the collections. Raffles hosted a party of Fellows of the Royal Society, "a magnificent set-out, top was a soup of swallows' nests", Raffles has brought back several boxes of them. [George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough's (1739-1817)] will: the Duchess will receive £10,000 per annum; the present Marquess and Lady Caroline £3000 per annum each; everything belonging to Blenheim [Palace] left to trustees; the family to live there with £30,000 per annum. Thanks Smith for "Compendium".</p></abstract>
