            <abstract><p>Congratulates Smith on the recovery of his health. His own health good except for a weakness in the hip. Forwarded Smith's enclosure to [Harvey] Spragg, thanks to convenience of new daily post.</p><p>Thinks that Sole of Bath, [Somerset], was too hasty is declaring 'Agrostis stolonifera' as "black couch" and "the worst grass that grows" in the Wiltshire Agricultural Report, as he [Johnes] is convinced that it will become the "most beneficial discovery that has been made". He was first alerted to it by the "greediness" of his cattle in seeking it out, and hopes to have nearly 100 acres of it next year.</p><p>Believes weather here is better than elsewhere; they have only had one very rainy day and are in expectation of a good harvest. Current politics are "disgusting", and expects the Catholics to "be thrown aside" in spite of the "fine promises" made.</p></abstract>
