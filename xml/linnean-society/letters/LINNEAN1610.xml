            <abstract><p>Received his father's letter. Sorry to hear of John's [brother of Smith] disappointment but glad to hear of scheme for him to go into trade. Had various intentions of where to go but now intends to spend all his time in Paris, especially as Broussonet has so many connections. His possession of Linnaean collections of more use to him here than in England, as here everybody looks to him for information and eager to communicate; feels danger of becoming too vain. Not pleased with the national character here.</p><p>Excursions: disappointed by Versailles gardens; saw the King [Louis XVI (1754-1793)] and family; horror at the "daubing of the ladies cheeks"; visited Marechal de Nouailles, whose companion, Mr Le Breton, is translating his two pamphlets into French; a hunt by the King; coffin of James II. [Richard] Salisbury has returned to England.</p></abstract>
