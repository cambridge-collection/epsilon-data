            <abstract><p>Gladly accepts Smith's proposal to have [Thomas] Beddoes' [(1760-1808), chemist and physician] call on him, as since hearing of Beddoes giving himself a dangerous disorder to try the effect of medicine "for the benefit of mankind" would be proud to know him. Read Beddoes' "[History of] Isaac Jenkins" [story exhibiting the evils of drunkeness] with great pleasure and requests copies for distribution amongst English readers here, and with Beddoes' permission will ask his parson to try and translate it into Welsh as he believes it will do much good.</p><p>Mrs Johnes thanks Smith for ordering plants. Hoping for this year to put an end to his "money distresses". Mrs Johnes very unwell and they cannot get a change of air on account of their "little invalid" [his daughter, Mariamne Johnes]. Mr Williams thinks Mariamne's back is well and that one of the lower vertebrae is prominent, and she has outgrown her machine; describes her other symptoms, which alarm him. He is unwell, too, and asks if Beddoes could be compelled to hasten his tour and visit early for the good of his house. Sorry Smith's sister-in-law continues "so ill".</p></abstract>
