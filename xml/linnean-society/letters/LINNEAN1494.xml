            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter [of 17 February 1792] and parcel containing "Flora Lapponica"; missing sheets. Unsure whether to go on with [James] Dickson's ["Hortus siccus Britannicus"] as it is expensive for duplicates and moderate specimens. Thanks for specimens of 'Iberis amara' and 'Lycoperdon cancellatum', which is definitely the "nidus of insects".</p><p>Congratulates Smith on "high honour" of organising the Queen's [Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744-1818)] herbarium but fears the main benefit will be opportunity of consulting [John] Lightfoot's herbarium, as the King [George III (1738-1820)] and Queen are "famous for being satisfied with the honour which their acceptance of obligations confers" and gives example of a friend who gave a Hunter to the King for free.</p><p>Alarmed to hear of the Pantheon fire [a theatre near Smith's house] and danger to Smith's health and library; asks if the apothecary whose premises were damaged by falling of the inner walls some days later was [Robert] Batty's. [John] Pitchford passed on letter from [James] Sowerby requesting specimens of fungi; will endeavour to supply him, lists those he could send now.</p><p>"Buried" in snow at present. Intends to attend Linnean Society anniversary meeting. They are to petition "all over Suffolk" against the slave trade.</p></abstract>
