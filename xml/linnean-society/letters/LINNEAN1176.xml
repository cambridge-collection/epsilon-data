            <abstract><p>Heavy snow fall delayed receipt of Smith's letter of 15 [March]. Condolences on death of Smith's father; comments that in such "melancholy cases" faith is the only recourse and blasts the French for attempting to take from the "wretched" their only consolation. Since his last letter they have been "seriously alarmed" at their daughter's health and Dr [David] Davies of Carmarthen stayed for a week; she is now improving and will come to Londonwith them. Details regarding departure of his sister, Charlotte, with the Kindersleys, to India._x000D_</p><p>Everything quiet in this part of the country and if the magistrates had "not acted imprudently" no agitation would have been needed: due to scarcity of food they must import barley or there will be famine before next harvest and got rid of the cavalry to save the horses from eating the poor's oats. Glad to hear that Smith's health improved and invites him to return from London with them for a change of air.</p></abstract>
