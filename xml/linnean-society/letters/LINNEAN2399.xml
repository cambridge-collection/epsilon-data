            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 9 [August 1814] but unfortunately state of his health since arrival in London prevents him from enjoying the society of his scientific friends, more so as Smith was to be one of them. Feeling stronger since the effects of the mercury subsided and as he expects a few years longer life hopes visit Smith in Norwich soon. They are giving up plans to go to Scotland and will either stay in London or go to France for the winter.</p><p>Madagascar specimens received from Sir Joseph Banks, wishes Smith had taken his share on leaving town, and still awaiting the Indian specimens from Banks, asks how to make selection available to Smith. Has not heard anything respecting [Francis] Buchanan from the fleet just arrived.</p><p>[Note in different hand addressed to Roxburgh, Prospect Place] List of 4 species of 'Ophioglossum': 'O. filiforme', 'O. scandens', 'O. flexuosum', and 'O. furcatum'; asks Smith if they should be contained in the same genus or placed in 'Lygodium' or any other new genus.</p></abstract>
