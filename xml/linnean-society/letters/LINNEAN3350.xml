            <abstract><p>Thanks for "Linnean Transactions". Hopes Smith and Sir Joseph Banks have received the copies of his "Prodromus". Missed Smith whilst he was visiting England. Defends himself against not having mentioned Smith in the preface of his "Prodromus" by stating he consulted the duplicates in Carl Linnaeus junior's herbarium and other collections connected with Linnaeus including Dr Dahl's, same applies to his "Obervationes", a copy of which he has sent to Smith. Warns Smith of possible errors in the 'Cryptogamic' section of Linnaeus' herbarium as many were collected by himself, states an error noticed by [James] Dickson. Long list of desiderata [on second folio, some names have a pencilled tick against them]. Asks for Smith's observations on enclosed 'Carex' specimens [not extant].</p><p>[Smith has noted on verso of second folio] "if my friend Mr Afzelius should be met with, to beg to be remembered to him".</p></abstract>
