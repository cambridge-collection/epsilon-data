            <abstract><p>Sends Smith remainder of his Bulliard ["Histoire des champignons"], found in confusion of removing his books [to Walcot Hall, Diss]. Asks after Smith's works, as he is more out of the world here than he was at Bungay, [Suffolk]. [John] Stackhouse to publish third fasciculus [of his "Nereis Britannica"]: he sent it to [Dawson] Turner for review, who was to forward it to himself, before he forwarded it onto Smith, but Turner never sent it on. Received letter from young Withering concerning claim made by [John] Stokes [(1755-1831)] for profits of third edition of [William] Withering's ["Botanical arrangement"]; thinks he has no right; either 15,000 or 1,500 copies sold; notices a fourth edition has since been published, probably rushed out before Smith completes his book ["Flora Britannica"].</p></abstract>
