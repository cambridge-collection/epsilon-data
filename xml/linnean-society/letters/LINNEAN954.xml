            <abstract><p>Letter is written around two botanical plates.</p><p>[Jacques] Dorthes of Montpellier, [France], an excellent correspondent for Davall. Proposing [Dominique] Villars a FMLS on strength of his book and has initiated correspondence. [Jean Louis Antoine] Reynier's [(1762-1824), botanist] "impertinent" to think Davall should write a continuation of his "silly Memoirs". Requests specimen of 'Carex tomentosa'. Discusses observations on 'Chenopodium polyspermum' in Davall's last letter, thinks a discovery has been made. Requests specimen of Leers' 'Hypericum dubium' to compare against his '[Hypericum] perfoliatum'.</p><p>The King [George III (1738-1820)] went "in great state" to St Paul's cathedral yesterday to give thanks for his recovery. Kew catalogue nearly complete, as is his own "[Plantarum] Icones" and "Rudbeck[ianae]". Beginning short course of botanical lectures on 5th May; [William] Curtis now too rich to lecture. Has fruits of Sir Joseph Banks to send [Jacob] Wyttenbach. Davall's 'Draba saxatilis' should be called 'Draba stellata' as published by [Nikolaus] Jacquin in "Enumeratio" pp.113 and 256. Lord Gainsborough [Henry Noel] elected Honorary Member at Linnean Society anniversary meeting. Swiss plants much esteemed in England; Forsyth has lately brought over a large collection. [Jonas] Dryander has ensured a 'Smithia sensitivia' will be in Kew catalogue. L'Heritier has acted "shabbily" by dating his monograph on 'Columniferae' 1785 so as to appear as though written before [Antonio Jos√©] Cavanille's book on same, they are having a dispute in "Journal de Paris"; Dryander openly attacks L'Heritier as "one of the most sneaking unprincipled of men".</p></abstract>
