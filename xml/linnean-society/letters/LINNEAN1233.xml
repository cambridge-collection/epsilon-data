            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter and condolences, "the blow has been most severe, and more so, from bring so very unexpected" [possibly death of his sister, Elizabeth, wife of Hanbury Williams]. Will assist Smith in the publication of his "Tour of Hafod", though warns his circle of friends has reduced considerably. Not surprised by [Richard] Salisbury's conduct. Glad Smith likes [Benjamin] Malkin's [(1769-1842), antiquarian] book ["The Scenery, Antiquities, and Biography of South Wales" (1804)], who is a friend of his. Mariamne [Johnes, his daughter] is well and walks 5 to 7 miles daily. news. Asks that they be remembered to the Mr and Mrs Kindersley; "had our strange sister [Charlotte] followed his advice it would have been better for her".</p></abstract>
