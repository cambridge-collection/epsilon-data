            <abstract><p>Responds to Smith's letter of 28 October [1795]. Regrets not marrying an Englishwoman as he now feels exiled from England and Smith, and tormented by notion that his children are strangers both in country of their birth and native country of their father. Has bound all correspondence received from Smith to fulfill Smith's request that if either of them should die the letters be returned to the other. Despondent that his life not as happy as it would have been if he had lived nearer to Smith but consoled that Smith's affection for him has grown with his increase of occupations, connections, and distance between them; hopes he and Mrs Smith will visit.</p><p>Wrote to Smith 10 November enclosing 'Digitalis' seed from 1794, recommends it to [James] Lee though it probably will not rise till spring 1797. Was not well last summer so did not collect 'Saxifragus mutata' as intended.</p></abstract>
