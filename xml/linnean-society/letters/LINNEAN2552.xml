            <abstract><p>Account of his return journey [from Birmingham], which included a week long visit to London and a brief stay in Oxford, where his pamphlet ["A defence of the Church and Universities of England" (1819)] was much admired; concedes that with his appointment to "Flora Graeca" he has been met "uniformly with liberality, both in publick and private".</p><p>Has signed a letter of thanks, along with other members of his congregation, to Mr Aspland, for his two letters printed in the London papers "in defence of our abused &amp; caluminated sect". Very busy but hopes to take his "English Flora" in hand. Thanks for gift of "elegant volume". Hopes Yates will allow him to return favour of Yate's hospitality. His compliments to the Corrie family. The specimens of Birmingham manufacture all much approved.</p></abstract>
