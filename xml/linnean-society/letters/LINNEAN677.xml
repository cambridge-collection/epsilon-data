            <abstract><p>Hopes Smith is better, all in London were surprised to see one so "abstemious" suffering from fever; recalls Mrs Delaney, companion of the old Duchess of Portland, dying of one at 93. The 'Sedum ochroleucum' Smith sent is in good health but of the two carnations only the straw-coloured one produced flowers and the "piquote" one died. Compliments Smith on his handling of engaging the Prince Regent as patron of the Linnean Society; thinks there will be no impediments to Bishop of Durham [Shute Barrington] now becoming an honorary member. Hopes Smith's friend [William Fitt] Drake will succeed [in his training for the clergy], and that he will think for himself. Carlisle botanists disappointed Smith is not visiting this year; one of them, Mr Holme of Peterhouse, finds good things. Has given one of his vacant prebends to his second son, Robert, who has married Miss Markdam, and has also preferred several other family members.</p></abstract>
