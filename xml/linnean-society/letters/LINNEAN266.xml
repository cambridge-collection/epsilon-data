            <abstract><p>Arrangements for printing of papers. Sorry "Linnean Transactions" vol 8 is so thin; his paper on 'Brodiaea' would have helped and is a fresh reason why he regrets not publishing it now. [James] Brodie's friends think not publishing it defeats the compliment, and all think it an "undue deference to a villain who is our disgrace" [Richard Salisbury had published 'Brodiaea' as 'Hookera' in "Paradisus Londinensis"]; several Council members lamented to see him forced to yield to "such opposition" and the brutality with which it was enforced. He knows Macleay acted for the best and feels the "bulk of the Society entirely guiltless", and will continue to send papers.</p><p>Has requested proofs of all [James] Sowerby's plates for his and [William Jackson] Hooker's papers on mosses, following the mistake he made with 'Hookeria lucens' in "English botany". Expecting a visit from [Robert] Brown.</p></abstract>
