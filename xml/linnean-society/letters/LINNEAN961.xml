            <abstract><p>Continues his numbered comments on plants in Davall's packet of July 1791: 'Salix incubacea', 'Dianthus carthusianorum', 'Dianthus virgineus' [Nikolaus von] Jacquin "Florae Austriacae" vol 5 t 15 also 'Dianthus rupestris', 'Arenaria dianthoides', 'Dianthus diminutus', 'Arabis bellidifolia', 'Arabis hispidia' "Hortus Kewensis", error in 'Arabis hispida' "Systema Vegetabilum" ed 14, 'Turritis hirsuta', 'Turritis alpina', 'Cheiranthus erysimoides', 'Cheiranthus fruticulosus', 'Rannunculus gramineus', 'Arenaria pubescens', 'Cynoglossum'. Transcribes extract from his fern paper on genus 'Davallia', observations and species. Puzzled by 'Thlaspi', fears he told Davall wrong about his C in parcel of 1791, and that it is 'perfoliatum'; intends to tackle this genus after 'Arenaria'.</p><p>His "Sketch of a Tour on the Continent" taking much of his time. Responds to Davall's letter of 11 January 1793: agrees with Davall on the French character; has communications with the Queen on plants; thinks he will soon be able to live by his own means; thanks Davall for recommending him to the Duchess of Devonshire [Georgiana Cavendish (1757-1806)].</p><p>Thinks Lady Rockingham is "too much a slave to her servants" and does not like her gardener, Greg. Will send plants for Davall from Botany Bay by Mr Mandrot. Not yet started on [Horace Bénédict] de Saussure's [(1740-1799)] lichens. Received encouraging letter from [Adam] Afzelius and François [Borone] in Sierra Leone; account of violence reported in Berne Gazette was probably occassioned by disturbance at Bulam. Glad to give 'Linum tenuifolium' to English botanists as they considered it an English plant. Aims to write six printing pages of his "Tour" every day. Hopes to get Davall a Dillenius ["Historia muscorum" (1741)] for about £10.</p></abstract>
