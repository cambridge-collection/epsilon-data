            <abstract><p>Staying with Lady [Pleasance] Smith's aunt, whose house and garden is a "specimen of what one reads about in English novels of the best age, before the history of manners &amp; character gave way to the picturesque or the frightful", although the journey caused his fever to return, which was treated with bleeding and James's powder.</p><p>Printing new editions of his "Compendium florae Britannicae" and "Introduction [to Botany]", and anticipates the continuation of "English Flora" to be "merely a pleasure &amp; amusement". Resolved to limit his letter writing, "especially in reply to foolish schemes &amp; questions about botany"; he is now being solicited about a Norwich Botanic Garden, certain it will not amount to anything. Criticises missing date in Roscoe's last letter.</p><p>Received from Paris "Annales de las Societe Linneenne de Paris", containing an eulogy of Broussonet. CorrÃªa has died at Lisbon; he had been a "little perverted by French botanists" and developed a "jealous twist" against Englishmen, especially Sir Joseph Banks.</p></abstract>
