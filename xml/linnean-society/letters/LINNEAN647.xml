            <abstract><p>Smith's reply to Goodenough's letter dated 12 November 1808. Has Bodaeus' Theophrastus but as [John] Sibthorp's intention was to illustrate Dioscorides does not intends to go further with "Flora Graeca" or "Florae Graecae Prodromus". Requests Goodenough's advice whether to follow [Richard] Salisbury's new generic name for 'Nymphaea alba', 'Castalia', after the manner the petals "chastely fold over &amp; cover the organs of impregnation", in "Florae Graecae Prodromus". Smith would prefer it to be after the Castalian fountain of Greek mythology. Salisbury has separated it from 'Nymphaea lutea' as proposed by Smith in "Introduction to Botany". Believes that 'Nymphaea alba' in Dioscorides provides enough evidence for keeping that name and proposes 'Blephara', also from Dioscorides, for the other generic name, and provides characters for each. Observes how curious it is that 'Nymphaea alba' is strictly gynandrous according to the more correct character of 'Gynandria'.</p><p>Believes he has quoted Dr [John] Hull [(1761-1843), physician and botanist] more than commending him, he is a "mere compiler". Bishop of Norwich [Henry Bathurst (1744-1837)] gratified to hear of Goodenough's remembrances and is quite recovered, although he lately had a fall at Holkham, [Norfolk, home of Thomas William Coke] after opening the cellar door. Asks Goodenough to frank enclosed letter to Mrs Smith in Liverpool. Amelia Hume's 'Chrysanthemum indicum' in flower. Will send part of his 'Sedum ochroleucum' in a frank for Goodenough to grow.</p></abstract>
