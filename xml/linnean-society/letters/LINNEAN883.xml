            <abstract><p>Discusses learned societies: informed by Sir George Staunton of the founding of the Asiatic Society of London; anxious for the prosperity of the Linnean Society, asks if the vice-president, [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert, and [Robert] Brown communicate with Smith; laments death of Sir Joseph Banks [president of Royal Society] and reserved behaviour of Lord Aberdeen [George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen (1784-1860)], president of Antiquarian Society; requests copy of 1819 Linnean Society list.</p><p>Reported in newspaper that [George] Leathes [(1779-1836)] caught a live 'Ampelis garrulus' in his hothouse and is feeding it on grapes, juniper berries, and raisins; Cullum would like to see if it can live on misletoe berries. Just received fifth volume of [John] Latham's "[A general history of] Birds", has subscribed in friendship and knowing of his difficult financial affairs due to his son's imprudence. Asks if Smith knows what plant 'Buchu' is as the leaves of it are being advertised in a pamphlet to treat complaints of the urethra and vesica urinaria [Smith has annotated in pencil that "'Buchu' is the Hottentot name" for 'Diosma'].</p></abstract>
