            <abstract><p>Has been excavating tumuli near Stonehenge with Sir Richard Hoare, research for Hoare's "History of Ancient Wiltshire". His "Girald Cambren" ["Giraldus de Barri"] to be published next winter. Hoare's is "the largest private library" he ever saw, including an unnamed book with an excellent figure of papyrus growing in Sicily. Unsurprised by Smith's comments on [Richard] Salisbury, has "long thought him to belong to the tribe of Ishmael". Pleased with [William George] Maton's work but disappointed he does not mention the Linnaean collections or present state of botany ["A general view of the writings of Linnaeus"]. Will send Smith a list of his herbarium. Wants [William Fitt] Drake to see if there are many duplicate specimens of 'Fosteria' in Forster's herbarium. Arrival of [William] Roxburgh who has brought seed collections. Received live plants and seeds from Dr [Thomas] Dancer [(c 1750-1811) island botanist of Jamaica] including 'Cinchona caribaea', believes this to be first raised in England. States that his 'Ochroma' are now one of "the most magnificent botanical sites in the kingdom". Disappointed Smith is not visiting this summer.</p></abstract>
