            <abstract><p>Smith's last 6 weeks completely occupied "in body &amp; mind", whilst she has been enjoying "complete repose". Asks if Smith has seen his admirers Mr Nicholls and [Thomas James] Mathias [(1754-1835), satirist], if the latter is author of "Pursuits of Literature" [a satirical poem published 1794, Mathias was the author] his praise is "no mean commendation". Sorry to observe in note to that work a question on how ladies could be "modestly instructed in botany", believes Dr [Erasmus] Darwin to be thanked for this censure; will be glad to see "this beautiful &amp; innocent study rescued from all objection" by Smith' pen, further discussion of this. If Dr [Henry] Reeve settles at Norwich it will preclude all of Smith's ideas [possibly regarding practising medicine], but she would be happy for them to be in a cottage than have the collections sold for a carriage. Her excursions around Lowestoft, including discharge of cannon by the fleet at Yarmouth, [Norfolk], in commemoration of 29 May. Recommends seeing Mr Angerstick's collection of pictures, going to Gisleham, [Suffolk].</p></abstract>
