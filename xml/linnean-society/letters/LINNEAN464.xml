            <abstract><p>Sends a collection of 200 mosses largely gathered in the county of Kerry in 1796. Has moss specimens for [Dawson] Turner should he want them. Sends rare Irish plants and gives habitats: 'Sium verticillatum' at Loun Bridge, near Killarney; 'Bartsia viscosa' as in his "Plantae rarior"; and 'Saxifraga geum' or 'S. hirsuta' (hopes to determine which when it flowers from the seeds and roots he planted) from Gap of Dunloc which divides Mac-Gilly-Cuddy's Reeks from Tornies Mountain and is the direct road to the Purple Mountain, near Killarney.</p><p>Remarks and observations on various plants from the same mountain area: extraordinary varities of 'Saxifraga umbrosa'; 'Pinguicula lusitanica' is common; 'Schoenus rufus' abundant on Purple Mountain; 'Euphorbia hiberna' uniformly furnished with "umbella quinquefida", many between thirty and forty inches high, almost has a completed figure, a necessity for the Irish plant as no others approach it except "Hortus Elthamensis" t.290; 'Serapis latifolia' very common about peninsula of Mucruss; 'Orobanche elatior' and 'Polypodium cambricum' in profusion in ruins of abbey at Mucruss; considers 'Aspidium oreopteris' and 'Adiantum capillus-veneris' rare ferns. Asks if Smith considers 'Schoenus marisus' rare. 'Hymenophyllum tunbridgense' abundant on mountains of Kerry; 'Osmunda regalis' grows to a luxuriant state that makes it more resemble a shrub than a fern on islands in the range and upper lakes at Killarney. Was sent by an unnamed acquaintance of Smith 'Subularia aquatica', in fact 'Littorella lacustris'.</p><p>Sends remarks on 'Holcus odoratus' and 'Buddlea globosa'. Asks if Smith knows a coloured figure of 'Holcus odoratus'. Still waiting for John Templeton's "Flora of Ireland", unsure likelihood of his own appearing.</p></abstract>
