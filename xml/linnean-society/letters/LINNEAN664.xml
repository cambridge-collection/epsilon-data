            <abstract><p>His brother who lived near Sir William East's in Hurley was so captivated by the "poisonous doctrines of Voltaire &amp; the new philosophy" that he thought he had a right "to go out of life as soon as he was tired of it". Franked Smith's letter to Mr Shepherd. Glad to hear that [George] Don is keen to increase his communications; takes it as a sign for his desire of improvement. The carnations Smith sent are alive and growing; they are being kept in the original ball of earth, wrapped in newspaper, and the whole constantly moistened as he kept the roots of 'Ligustium cornubiense' before planting at Bulstrode [home of Dukes of Portland]. The name of Bulstrode "agitates his mind. 'Monotropa hypopitys' used to grow in Bisham woods, [Berkshire], was sent it from there by Revd Sir Henry Parker. 'Primula farinosa' lining roadsides and over meadows in Cumberland, took roots of it for his garden.</p></abstract>
