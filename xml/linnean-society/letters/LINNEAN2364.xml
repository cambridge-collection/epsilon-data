            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 17 March [1789]. Explains the difficulties he has in pursuing botany: too busy with his medical practice to botanise in local area, and too far from London to study exotics, which confines his studies to books, of which he has none.</p><p>Informed by [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert of formation of the Linnean Society, thanks Smith for invitation to join and asks to pay his subscription as a sum rather than annually. Thanks for Smith's botanical information, as he no longer has a London botanical correspondent. Had hoped that [Thomas] Marsham's scheme would have "comprehended the whole Fauna", as on plan of "Fauna Suecica". Requests information on Smith's "Plantarum icones".</p><p>Signed [Josef Franz] Jacquin's Royal Society nomination certificate; offers to show Jacquin Dorset if his tour of Britain takes him west. Thanks Smith for invitation to view Linnaean collections.</p></abstract>
