            <abstract><p>Numerous accidents and illnesses having befallen his servants, including typhus fever, has thrown his household into confusion. Received a pot of 'Gloxinia speciosa' from Lady [Anne] Melville [(d 1841), wife of Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville]; at first sight the flower is similar to 'Digitalis'. Experienced a very favourable summer but their "greedy" farmers have been working on Sundays as if it were a perilous time. Goodenough reports that on the death of the Queen [Caroline (1768-1821), wife of George IV, died 7 August 1821] some initially put on deep mourning but stopped after finding the many did not; believes the Queen's trial was just used for party politics. Visited by family of the wife of his son, Edmund [the Cockerells]. Goodenough thinks the King [George IV (1762-1830)] is "enjoying himself finely" and that "the Irish were half out of their wits" [the King paid a state visit to Ireland in 1821]. Does not agree with the treatment prescribed for his granddaughter's bad back.</p></abstract>
