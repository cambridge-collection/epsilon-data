            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 12 [May]. Gained relief from the worst cough he ever had by applying a blister to his chest, and now so well as to go to Bath tomorrow, where he will bring drawings for Mr Edwards. When he returned to Hafod found that Mrs Johnes had "performed miracles", including finishing the conservatory. 'Azalea pontica' growing so well gardener is considering laying it to get more. Asks for any Botany Bay seeds Smith is sent by his friends. The Botany Bay Gum tree is dead but 'Assa foetida' alive, hopes to have two 'Strelitzia' next year, which had a narrow escape from being destroyed due to damp bottom. Asks Smith's opinion of Calonne's museum, which he has been offered and would like to buy for his daughter [Mariamne Johnes]. Received magnificent present from Sir John Sebright [7th baronet (1767-1846) ?] of Edward Lloyd's [Edward Lhuyd (1660-1709), naturalist and antiquary ?] collection of Welsh manuscripts.</p></abstract>
