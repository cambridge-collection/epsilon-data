            <abstract><p>Sends remainder of Bulliard's ["Histoire des champignons"] and text, finally sent by L'HÃ©ritier; Woodward's account. Miss [Sarah Sophia] Banks [(1744-1818)] enquires after Bungay tradesmen's tokens or halfpence, for her collection. None of his works ready for two months; busy on his "Tour". Sales of "English botany" have increased since the enlargement. Did not review [William] Withering's book, and confirms he has only ever reviewed three: Berkenhout's "new edition" [of "Clavis Anglica linguae botanicae" (1789)], Curtis' "Magazine", and a pamphlet on silk worms, all in "Analytical Review"; does not intend to write any others.</p><p>Can easily see how Princess Elizabeth's [(1770-1840), daughter of George III] "winning condescension [and] looks so full of soul" could be mistaken by "a fool or a coxcomb" as a passion for himself; admits he is flattered by the attention she pays to his lessons. Lady [Amelia] Hume found the "City &amp; Country Mouse" in Swift's works. His paper on ferns is for the Turin Academy as thanks for making him one of their 20 foreign members, in place of Franklin and in company of Priestly and Herschell. His picture is being drawn for the Exhibition, for Sir Abraham Hume, he is to have a frond of 'Woodwardia radicans' in his hand.</p><p>Sends his Matlock, [Derbyshire], lichens, and 'Convallaria verticillata', from Scotland. Amused by reports of his sister being offered Miss [Fanny] Burney's [(1752-1840), novelist and Second Keeper of the Robes to the Queen] place [in attendance on the Queen], which are without foundation; "you have no idea what tittle tattle is at Windsor".</p></abstract>
