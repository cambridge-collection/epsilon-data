            <abstract><p>Note by Davall letter received 28 March 1794.</p><p>Numbered botanical observations on packet of plants received from Davall 10 September [sent 16 August 1793]: 'Eriophorum alpinum', 'Melica ciliata', 'Avena orientalis', 'Saponaria ocymoides', 'Anemone alpina', 'Orchia abortiva', 'Ophrys ovata', 'Carex', 'Carex pauciflora', 'Carex leporina' HL, 'Carex chordorhiza', '[Salix triandra]', 'Lichen rimosus', 'Lichen perlatus', 'Linum flavum', 'Saxifraga mutata' HL. Gave [Samuel] Goodenough all of the 'Carex' specimens [HL probably signifies Herbarium Linnaeus].</p><p>Responds to Davall's letter of 13 October 1793: received and distributed seeds; anecdote of Haller's herbarium and fireworks came too late for printing in third volume of his "Sketch of a tour on the continent"; the liquor he uses to protect his plants is the Cajeput oil of 'Melaleuca leucadendron' "a thing not to be had but by chance and seldom pure", camphor also good either alone or dissolved in [spirit vinegar]; currently bathing his insects and moving them to a new cabinet.</p><p>Responds to Davall's letter of 6 December 1793: pleased by comments on Haller's herbarium and Davall's opinion of the matter; François [Borone] shortly leaving for Greece with [John] Sibthorp, although he is not permitted to collect his own plants; [Adam] Afzelius shortly returning to Sierra Leone, against his advice; does not pity Davall over the younger Haller's actions and urges him to publish whatever he has finished to avoid becoming like Sibthorp and his "Florae Graecae", although admits himself facing similar difficulties with his "Systema Vegetabilium" and is going on with a "Flora Britannica" in Latin; Este well and living 6 St George's Row, his travels to be published soon.</p><p>Responds to Davall's letter of 25 February 1794: condolences on death of Davall's aunt; busy with writing and two courses of lectures and another beginning at Guy's Hospital; his "Tour" meets with "unexpected commendation" and is selling fast, "the political part seems to conciliate most people"; difficulties with [Horace Bénédict] de Saussure's [(1740-1799)] lichens. His health good, Lady Rockingham "grows more whimsical and retired" but has heard nothing of the Duchess of Devonshire or Lady Dowager Spencer. A translation by a "hackney writer" [Joseph Trapp] of [Dietrich Heinrich] Stoever's "Life of Linnaeus" to be published. Offers specimen of 'Ophrys loeselii'.</p></abstract>
