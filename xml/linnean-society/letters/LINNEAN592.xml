            <abstract><p>Correction of his Latin used in his description of 'Carex axillaris' [for his paper 'Observations on the British Species of Carex']. Unsure if he can see Smith at Kew on Wednesday. Further details of a letter previously sent but apparently lost. Sorry to hear that the Queen [Charlotte (1744-1818), wife of George III] has been so "[un]impressed" [by Smith's remarks on the French Queen, Marie Antoinette, in his "Sketch of a Tour on the Continent"]; "Kings &amp; Queens naturally like to have the cause of Kings &amp; Queens be praised". Another letter containing a draft for money has also been lost; informed that his postman is "drunk daily" but dares not have him turned out as he has eight children to feed. Promises Smith the lost letter did not contain any critique of his work, only pointed out passages for praise or those which might be taken amiss.</p></abstract>
