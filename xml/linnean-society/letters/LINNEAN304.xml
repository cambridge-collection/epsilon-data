            <abstract><p>Thanks for Macleay's letter and interest in his concerns. Sorry Macleay has been so busy, but rejoices at the "glorious cause" of his multiplied engagements", in reference to the Dutch. Sent Macleay game from Holkham [Hall, home of Thomas William Coke], where the Duke of Gloucester [Prince William (1776-1834), chancellor of Cambridge University] was also staying.</p><p>He has made "considerable progress" in his views at Cambridge [candidacy for botany professorship], does not doubt succeeding, and may get botanic garden appointment in the meantime, enabling him to lecture in April, but more doubtful of this. Determined not to be knighted until he at least gets that appointment; thanks for Macleay's assistance, means to receive it as president of the Linnean Society. Asks that the Society forward money owing to [James] Sowerby, who is in debt with him, as are [John] Sibthorp's executors.</p></abstract>
