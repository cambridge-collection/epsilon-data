            <abstract><p>Intends to open a school for "young gentlemen" at Christmas, encloses card [extant], hopeful of its answering.</p><p>At Smith's request informs him of his family's acquaintance with Dr Hurlock, who cured his father "of a sort of cancer in his mouth". Asks if Smith saw the plants Hurlock received from Labrador, which were gathered by his [Turner's] mother, and his mother brought a box of roots when his parents returned to England. Mr Burkard probably the only person in Labrador still gathering plants. Does not remember much of the time he spent in Labrador as a child. Hopes to visit Smith next summer.</p><p>Card announcing Turner's school and cost of lessons.</p></abstract>
