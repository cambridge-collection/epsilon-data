            <abstract><p>Sorry Smith's health obliges him to employ an amanuensis. They have lost a score of trees to the severe weather and high winds, though they have had little snow. Mariamne [Johnes, his daughter], returns her thanks to Smith; she stopped using the machine [for a spinal complaint] a long time ago, and doubts she will take Smith's advice as she complains of it "hurting her eye, &amp; affecting her head". Hopes to avoid London this year as he has so much work with his printing press. Invites Smith to divert to Hafod during his trip to Bath, [Somerset], and Liverpool, [Lancashire]. Mr Brigstocke and his family of Blaenpant are good friends of his; hopes Smith's acquaintance will be comfortable there and expects to see her. Asks if Smith has read [Thomas] Beddoes' [(1760-1808), chemist and physician] pamphlet on gout; he is convinced.</p></abstract>
