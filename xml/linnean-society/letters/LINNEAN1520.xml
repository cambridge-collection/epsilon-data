            <abstract><p>Sorry Smith will not be visiting during his stay in Norfolk, but consoled by promise of summer visit. Laments death of Smith's brother, Richard, "a strong proof, how little great abilities &amp; splendid genius avail, when not under the guidance of judgement, &amp; how dangerous it is for a young man to give away to habits of indolence &amp; inactivity". Admires Smith's "Tour", especially the preface, and thinks they must be "highly entertaining to a general reader", and of special interest to naturalists; problems with the copy; intends to order it in for his book club. Asks after separation of the "Natural History of New Holland" into botany and zoology volumes.</p><p>Received letter from [Samuel] Goodenough, who is in "great distress" over a fever at his school which has killed Mr Egereton, only son of Lord [Thomas] Grey de Wilton [1st Earl of Wilton (1749-1814)]; Smith had previously pronounced the boy "short lived". Sends sample of his and Goodenough's paper on 'Fucus'; their plan and comments. Notes on 'Ulva diaphara' of [William] Hudson's he has found.</p><p>[In Smith's hand at top of verso of first folio] Notes on 'Fucus capreolatus' Banks Herbarium being 'F. pinnatus' of Hudson.</p></abstract>
