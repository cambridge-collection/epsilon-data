            <abstract><p>Happy to see Macleay's handwriting, does not complain of him "as of many people for forcing me to write letters, on w[hi]ch subject some people have no discretion". His "whole daylight" devoted to third volume of his "[English] Flora". His health much restored but lost most of his teeth, long account of his recent illness. "Letter-writing is incompatible with Flora-writing", recent progress. Intends to come to London in April or May [1825] after completing third volume. Complains of "puppies chattering about natural orders which they do not understand"; the more that has been done in botany the more mistakes he finds.</p><p>Hopes to make "some stay" in London, including sitting for [Francis Leggatt] Chantrey [(1781-1841), sculptor] and fulfilling his engagement of lecturing at the London Institution. [Robert] Brown the only writer he finds "most in the right"; now realises he has praised [Augustin] de Candolle too much, as he has made many errors.</p><p>Hopes Macleay favours [John] Frost's election as FLS.</p></abstract>
