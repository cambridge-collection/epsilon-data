            <abstract><p>Sends seed-spike from what he believes to be an undescribed species of 'Phleum' [extant], grown from seeds from north-east of Poland and adjoining part of Russian Empire. Makes his own observations and states differences from 'Phleum pratense', to which he believes it will "prove superior [...] for agricultural purpose". If it is a new species requests Smith name it in a manner that relates to Knight's name and residence as the farmers whom Knight gives the seeds to will do the same and it is desirable that the "common and botanical name should be somewhat similar", as well as showing "whence and how it came into the country". Convinced by a seedling raised from a fruit stone from Siberia, and shown to Smith, that 'Prunus armeniaca' is a native of Siberia; it also bloomed in the Siberian manner, as soon as the snow disappeared. On verso of second folio Smith has written "Ansd. Phl pratense".</p><p>Specimen of 'Phleum' seed-spike.</p></abstract>
