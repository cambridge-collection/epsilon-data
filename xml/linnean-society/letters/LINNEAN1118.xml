            <abstract><p>Gave Smith's remembrances to Sir William and Lady East, she is a "most charming woman" who received great benefit from being in Exmouth. Sir William has recommended steaming, milk and figs or some softening effluvia for his daughter to promote suppuration and healing of the abscess which now certainly lies in the throat. His sister Mrs Nicholas has returned to London and Dr Moncrieffe prescribes continued use of foxglove though her stomach is destroyed. Bad weather destroyed 'Euphorbia paralias' he found though slowly sending 'Fucus' to [James] Sowerby. Has 'Fucus pulmatus' Lightfoot and is satisfied from his observations at Scarborough, [Yorkshire], that the species is distinct; observations on other varities including 'F. coriaceus', 'F. tureicus', and 'F. hepaticus'. Will save 'Lichen caliendrinus' to "ornament" Smith's head next anniversary. Encloses full sized specimen of Porteus 'Fucus ceranoides' of [William] Hudson and will collect all varieties for Sowerby; thinks he has seen the "Dyers Lichen" figured in "English Botany" but unable to get it off the rock.</p><p>Sir William asks what 'Laver' is, being convinced that it is "sea liverwort" and not 'Ulva lactua' of modern botanists.</p></abstract>
