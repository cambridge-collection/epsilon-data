            <abstract><p>Will endeavour to profit by Smith's "Grammar of Botany" and though glad he has explained [Antoine Laurent de] Jussieu's system will not bother to learn it as he does not find it "more natural" and there are irreconcilables in it. Praises the book's dedication.</p><p>Has written on identification of sex of woodcocks and commissioned a nephew in Dublin for opinion of Irish sportsmen; does not recall his authority for male's exterior quill feather to be barred the whole length, but the Irish think the male is larger, has most white at the edge, yellow legs, and a much darker head and neck, and the female dark slate coloured legs. Duke of Gordon's confirmation by examining supposed male "saw the testicles most distinctly".</p><p>He has two peach trees "just now showing their habitual excitability" which had just been transplanted out from glass to the open and protected them with oiled paper frames. His son's address whilst attending Parliament.</p><p>His weekly fish from Hartlepool, [Yorkshire], just come in, including more than 2lb 1/2 of whitings but often have them as large, and has lately had smelts more than 10 inches long.</p></abstract>
