            <abstract><p>Glad Smith has received "Flora Oxoniensis", explains its rushed production and how it only contains plants he has seen. In his opinion latter classes of Linnaean system benefit from being "melted down amongst the others" but concern that in Germany the mixing has "almost spoiled its shape and form", disliking especially Gmelin's mixing of 'Icosandria' and 'Polyandria'. Was ill in Constantinople with a bilious fever and colic but has since conducted a full botanical exploration of the Bosphorus, woods of Belgrade, and sands of Domusderi on Black Sea. Has observed nearly 800 plants and obtained seeds of 'Daphne pontica' and 'Convolvulus persicus'. Queries 'Epimedium alpinum', ubiquitous in Belgrade woods which are barley mountainous. Frustration at custom of burning of forests, "very unfriendly to researches of the Cryptogamist", has only observed 'Boletus lucidus' the 'Boletus marginalis' of [Pehr Forsskål (1732-1763)]. 'Rosa centifolia' grows wild, pleasant odour from its mixing with 'Smilax'. Shores of Bosphorus poor in 'Fucus' and 'Testacea'. Collected fifty species of fish, many species of 'Labrus' present, inferior flavour of 'Julus' which is often sold in markets. Dolphins playful in the Bosphorus, gulls are as tame as pigeons. 'Procellaria puffinus' known locally as "souls of the damned". A 'Percnopterus' [Egyptian vulture] perched in the tree he was reading under, "I could not resist, not having the fear of the Egyptians before my eyes, to shoot it". Insects limited to scorpions, mosquitos, bugs and 'Conops calcitrans'. [John] Hawkins is in "high preservation" and has "huge mustaches, which he is nursing" for a Syrian and Egyptian tour. Travelling with Hawkins in Greece to Thessaly, Attica and the Peloponnesus and wintering in Zante. In short postscript states that [François] Borone is in good health, "in action quite a Le Fleur".</p></abstract>
