            <abstract><p>Only lately received Smith's letter of 17 August [1807]; concerned he had lost Smith's correspondence. Praises Smith's "Introduction to Botany", which "will be the means of highly improving the theoretical part of [his] summer course"; the elementary texts he in general recommends his students are [James] Lee's "Introduction to Botany", [Jean-Jacques] Rousseau's [(1712-1778), philosopher] "Elements [of botany]", "Philosophia Botanica", and translations of Willdenow.</p><p>Smith missed opportunity to use his "Plantae rariores" as authority for 'Adiantum capillus-veneris' in "English botany" v22 1564, for which Smith credited [James Townsend] Mackay [(1775-1862), curator of Botanic Garden, Trinity College, Dublin], as did [Dawson] Turner in his "admirable" "Fucus" work.</p><p>Apologises for sending overweight parcel. Sent [James] Sowerby flowering specimens of true Irish 'Arbutus unedo' for mention in "English botany" and for honour of Ireland and its natural productions. Dr [Robert] Scott [(1757-1808)], professor of botany at [Trinity College, Dublin] deprived of his post without any equitable cause assigned. Asks if there are to be any new additions to new edition of Smith's "Tour of the Continent".</p></abstract>
