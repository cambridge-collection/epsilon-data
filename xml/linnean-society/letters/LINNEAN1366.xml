            <abstract><p>Replies to Roscoe's letters of 15 November and 16 December. Disappointed not to see Roscoe this summer and impatient for Roscoe's notes on 'Canna' species. Last paper of second volume of "Exotic botany" published and hopes to settle a permanent plan for its continuation or a new one like it next spring. Has written papers on British 'Hieracium', "papilionaceous decandrous plants of New Holland", three diadelphous genera, and working on one on 'Arenaria' to resolve dearth of papers at Linnean Society meetings, which are otherwise "very fully" attended. Second parts of "Flora Graeca" and "Florae Graecae prodromus" ready for publication. Thanks for Roscoe's praise of his paper on "shall &amp; will" [in October 1807 issue of the "Athenaeum"] and "Introduction to Botany"; half the edition is sold; will only correct a new edition.</p><p>Thanks for Roscoe's political pamphlet [on war with France, see RelatedMaterial below], which he agrees with entirely; further comments. Has completed 3000 species for Liverpool [Botanic Garden] herbarium. [Richard] Salisbury and Andrews, "a rogue &amp; a fool, a happy conjunction!", have combined to criticise Roscoe's 'Scitamineae' principle. Has written to editor of the "Monthly Magazine" about [William Fordyce] Mavor [(1758-1837)], who wrote Botany Report for this month's issue, and who was rejected by Linnean Society; expects it will be published next month.</p></abstract>
