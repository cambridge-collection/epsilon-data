            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter of 18 October and forwarded Smith's letter to Mr Scott. Compliments Smith and Bishop of Norwich [Henry Bathurst (1744-1837)] on their apt choice of reading material in the library at Holkham, [Norfolk, home of Thomas William Coke] and asks whether Roman Catholics attach any religious worth to the possession of missals, in reference to manuscript of the Greek Testament at Holkham. Surprised to hear that Smith is experiencing difficulties retrieving a manuscript from the widow of Kennicot.</p><p>Has not seen the "Monthly Review" since it started attacking the doctrines and establishment of the Church after the death of the editor [Ralph] Griffiths [(c 1720-1803)] but will look out for it [for Richard Salisbury's review of second edition of "Hortus Kewensis"]. Goodenough generally criticises Salisbury but asks if he praised "Hortus Kewensis" and wonders at his finally praising Smith [for granting of his knighthood]. Goodenough's daughter has given birth to her first son and his twenty-third grandchild, the boy is to be christened alongside daughter by his daughter, Charlotte, by his son, Samuel, in Rose Castle chapel.</p></abstract>
