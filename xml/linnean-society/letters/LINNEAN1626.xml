            <abstract><p>Pleased to hear of Smith's successes in Edinburgh; his hopes for him, certain he will "shun the immoral &amp; profane both from taste &amp; principle". Warns Smith against "gaiety" of Lubbock. Discusses Smith's recommendations and practicalities of his education there. Approves of Smith hiring a Latin tutor; importance of Latin and Greek. Benefits gained from study of nature. Glad Smith has so many ladies in his acquaintance but warns him against becoming distracted from his studies.</p><p>Smith's sister, Fanny, had a fever but now recovered and Nanny Cullyer, their last nursemaid, is dying from a putrid fever. Glad Smith met Lord Monboddo, usefulness of knowing such people. Reminds Smith not to press his stomach against the table when writing. News of [Thomas] Woodward, and criticisms of Mrs Patterson. Effects of the Dutch War on trade.</p></abstract>
