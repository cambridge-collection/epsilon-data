            <abstract><p>His 'Walteriana' dead, killed gardener attempting to lay it. The plant called "Wana Ta", by the person who gave them the seed, is in fact a creeper and none of the seeds Smith sent of it have germinated, encloses leaf of the plant [extant]. Encloses list of medicines [not extant] for Smith to order from Mr Wilson and have sent from London to Aberystwyth, by sea.</p><p>Has returned hom from his regiment to ensure all workmen are out before Smith's visit. Intense hot weather: his dry and can no longer be proud of his cascades. Progress of his work on [Jean] Froissart [(c 1337-1405), French chronicler]. Dr [James] Anderson's "capital improvements" for canals; persuaded him to patent some of them as he was also the author of the patent stove but did not get any thanks as Brodie took a patent out for it and Anderson was too liberal and indolent to fight for money. 'Dombeya' doing well.</p><p>Smith has outlined his reply on recto of second folio: asks if Johnes is home in September, as he is lecturing till 18 or 20 August and could be detained longer, and asks "of Fraser's 'Monandrous' plant".</p><p>Specimen of a leaf, [Smith annotation on label : "'Bigonia'?"].</p></abstract>
