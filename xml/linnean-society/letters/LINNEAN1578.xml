            <abstract><p>Busy correcting sheets, completing his index, and holding lectures. The lectures very crowded and seem "much approved". His travel arrangements. Received letter from [Edmund] Davall's eldest son, married and settled at Vevey, [Switzerland], and recommending his younger brother to Smith, who wishes to come to England; will write to prevent his coming. Another letter from George Hibbert about the gardener who is to go to Jamaica. [Thomas] Forster had an epileptic fit, he has been keeping them secret for 20 years. Staying next at [Edward] Forster's, Hale End, [Essex]. [James] Bicheno to become new Linnean Society secretary; [Joseph] Sabine made more of it that was just or true.</p><p>Called at Longman's: first two volumes of "English Flora" have just paid their expenses with half the stock sold, the remaining 800 copies to be all profit. Reviews his own lecture from yesterday. Bishop of Chester's [Charles Blomfield (1786-1857)] and Butler's debate at the Institution: both expose "much weakness" in the orthodox cause. Gave a speech at Linnean Society after list of subscribers to his bust was read. His strength, rheumatism, and cholic improved but cannot avoid perspiration at night. His Bristol lectures have been set to begin 13 June.</p></abstract>
