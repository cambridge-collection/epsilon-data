            <abstract><p>Apologises for not being able to spend more time with Smith and Lady [Pleasance] Smith during their recent stay in Liverpool. About to move to St James's Mount and unsure what course his life will take but hopes it will be removed from "mercantile speculations or the squabbles &amp; quibbles of lawyers". Comments on remarks made by the Chancellor respecting an incident involving his business troubles and an imminent change in law.</p><p>Responds to Smith's letter of from Arley Hall [28 July 1820] and thanks for introduction to Lord Mountnorris [George Annesley], whom he first met in London when they helped establish the African Institution. Comments on the curiousness of Mountnorris' East India 'Scitamineae' drawings of, particularly 'Zingiber'. Reminds Smith of a letter he previously wrote on genus 'Thalia', which is still in need of elucidation. Since Smith's departure 'Hedychium angustifolium' has flowered and 'Hedychium excelsum' is about to, and 'Alpinia mutica' for the first time in Britain. Tormented with rheumatism but intends to visit Norwich before winter.</p></abstract>
