            <abstract><p>Describes his return journey from Liverpool, which included a stop at Matlock, [Derbyshire], to climb on Cromford Moor, "often celebrated in "English Botany"", for the first time since 1792; saw many lichens but concludes the dry summer has prevented their fructification. Has informed [Thomas William] Coke about Roscoe's intended visit. The Bishop of Winchester [Brownlow North] delighted by his Cambridge pamphlet; finds it curious that four Oxford bishops approve of his candidacy for Cambridge botany professorship.</p><p>Received a "curious work" by Sprengel ["Plantarum Umbelliferarum" (1813)] in which 'Umbelliferae' is reformed as successfully as 'Scitamineae' was by Roscoe; transcribes a Greek quote referring to himself. Encloses packet of New Holland fern seeds. Lists stipulations if the [Liverpool Royal] Institution should invite him to lecture again, would also stay two months to study the Botanic Garden for a long held project on garden plants.</p><p>[Letter possibly incomplete: no signature or valediction]</p></abstract>
