            <abstract><p>Sorry that Smith could not view the gardens, conservatory, and greenhouses at Wentworth [Woodhouse, Yorkshire] on account of royal visit expected there, especially as she would have liked Smith's account of the plants there, which were all duplicates of the collection at Wimbledon, [Surrey]; the finest were always sent to Wentworth.</p><p>[James] Sowerby visited to draw 'Aralia [capitata]', he also drew life sized 'Pancratium amboinense', sends one of its eight flowers formed like an umbrella, fragrance like 'Cactus grandiflora'. Sends small part of 'Aralia' in full flower; invites Smith and [Richard] Salisbury to see it in person, presumes Salisbury's collection large enough for the plants Smith took for her not to be noticed. Her 'Portlandia' and 'Catesbaea' flowering a second time. [Jonas] Dryander took as yet only flower on the 'Martinia', expects it to be renamed.</p><p>Circumference of the umbrella of flowers of the 'Pancratium' is a yard and three-quarters and the bulb is 12 1/2 inches [Salisbury has annotated "probably a variety of 'P. caribaeum'].</p></abstract>
