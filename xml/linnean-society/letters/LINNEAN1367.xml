            <abstract><p>Immersed in politics; his new pamphlet on proposals to open negotiations for peace in 1807 is currently printing [see RelatedMaterial below], it also contains a definitive answer to his critics. The mayor of Liverpool, a "bigotted &amp; furious ministerialist", held a meeting "in commendation of the present men &amp; measures" [in relation to the war with France]; he [Roscoe] opposed this and offered an opposing address which was "carried by a great majority", but the mayor carried the original address. Both addresses were presented to the public for signatures; his [Roscoe's] address "favourable to peace &amp; moderation" gained almost 15,000 whilst the mayor's struggled for half that amount. The enraged opposition has been issuing handbills and anonymous letters; transcribes example of one sent to himself.</p><p>Recently sent [James] Sowerby a specimen of 'Canna latifolia' for "Exotic botany" but he had drawn it before; will soon send his thoughts on the genus. Urges Smith not to give up "Exotic botany", which could now be carried on in just the quatro edition. Thanks Frederick Smith [Smith's brother] for merino wool coat.</p></abstract>
