            <abstract><p>Hopes Smith received parcel sent on 13 October via Mr Sympson containing two letters for Smith and three parcels of seed including 'Minuartia campestris', 'Androsace lactea', and 'Lavatera punctata'.</p><p>Transcribes, in French, conversation with and letter from [Jacob] Wyttenbach about a Berne fireworks display which cost more than Haller's collections which the Berne authorities had refused to buy; laments that Haller's herbarium is not available for consultation in Berne. Unable to forward Smith's parcel to [Jacques] Dorthes in Montpellier as communications between there and Geneva have ceased.</p><p>Lists reasons for delays with his book: ill-health, lack of space, greater temptation of the "delightful verdure of the country", bad winter light, expanding his herbarium, caring for his garden, his wife's ill health , death of their first child, and family matters. As foreseen by Smith he was too communicative about his plans and Haller's son has taken advantage: after sending him specimens and observations received a manuscript titled "Tentamen additament" or "ad Hist. Stirp. Helv." to be printed in a German magazine in Berne containing articles Haller had no idea of before their "imprudent communications". Infant son in good health.</p></abstract>
