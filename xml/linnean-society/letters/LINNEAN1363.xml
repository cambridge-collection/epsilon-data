            <abstract><p>Disappointed that he cannot accept Roscoe's invitation. Rumoured that Roscoe will become the sitting member for Liverpool. Hopes to accompany his mother to Liverpool in early spring and would like to discuss Roscoe's 'Canna' specimens, figures, and synonyms, particularly species Roscoe made out of 'Canna indica', for intended paper on 'Scitamineae' species.</p><p>Sent the Linnean Society a "botanico-physiological" on germination of seeds, disproving Gaertner's "vitellus"; further details. Asks if Roscoe approves with his rule of "shall &amp; will" as he discussed in October issue of the "Athenaeum". Will shortly send Roscoe his "Introduction to Botany" for comment and corrections; hopes it will promote the study.</p><p>Hopes Roscoe has had the most recent numbers of "Exotic botany" from [James] Sowerby. Has written a lot for [Abraham] Rees' "Cyclopedia", and has enjoyed looking at botanical subjects he might not have otherwise studied. Glad Roscoe's Liverpool [Botanic] Garden is flourishing; had hoped to see [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden] in Norwich; apologises for delay in sending the herbarium, which is proving "a long &amp; arduous job". [William Fitt] Drake has entered Caius College, Cambridge, with one of the highest scholarships but will still assist Smith half the year. Continuing work on "Florae Graecae prodomus" but struggles to complete more than 10 to 12 plants from 10 o'clock till 3. Compliments to the Roscoe and Rathbone families. Relates a "curious anecdote" about the King of Prussia, Napoleon, and the Empress of Russia at the conference of Tilsit [ending the War of the Fourth Coalition, 1806-1807].</p></abstract>
