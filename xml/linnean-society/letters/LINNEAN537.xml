Portion of the Nepalese plants were collected within the first range of the Himalayas by the late Mr R Stuart, the Sumatra and Penang plants are from Mr Jack, employee of Sir Stamford Raffles [(1781-1826)]. Some of the scitamineae plants are for [William] Roscoe, pleased to hear from Roscoe that four new species of 'Roscaea' were amongst former parcels sent. Received a synoptic account of all the 'Hedychia' he has sent, by Roscoe. Hopes to gather more species of 'Hedychia' during his Nepal expedition commencing next July, intends to send regular parcels to Smith, Sir Joseph Banks, [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert, and [Henry Thomas] Colebrooke [(1765-1837), orientalist]. Was unable to send a chest of plants to the Linnean Society as he wished. Copies of first volume of [William] Roxburgh's "Flora Indica" sent for Smith and the Linnean Society. List of the plants contained in second volume of "Flora Indica", with observations.</p><p>Hopes Smith received his letters of 24 July and 6 August [1819] [not extant]. News of [Henry Lloyd] Loring [(c 1784-1822), Archdeacon of Calcutta].</p></abstract>
