            <abstract><p>Asks Roscoe to visit [Alexander] Macleay at the Transport Office to settle urgent questions regarding his 'Scitamineae' paper waiting to be printed; the law only allows Roscoe twelve copies of the paper. Pleased that Roscoe is finding multiple confirmations of his system; resolves to obtain "Flora Peruviana". Hopes Roscoe will encourage [James] Sowerby, who is "in despair about the work" ["Exotic botany"]; the publishers Longman &amp; Co. were to continue it but withdrew on finding the confusion surrounding it caused by Sowerby's poor business skills; [Smith] is keen for the final two parts of second volume to be published.</p><p>Informs Roscoe of how much he is "looked up to by the nation" on abolition of slavery, which is very popular with "all parties, clergy &amp; dissenters, quakers, aristocrats &amp; democrats, if good people", though some people fear Roscoe will compromise or fall short of expectations. Principle wish of the people is for "immediate abolition of the procurring slaves from Africa", and for emancipation to follow in time. Roscoe is taking a "decided lead" and it will lead him to greater political consequence as long as [William Wyndham] Grenville [1st Baron Grenville (1759-1834), prime minister 1806-1807] or another abolitionist does not take the glory. Invites Roscoe and family to Norwich for Easter.</p></abstract>
