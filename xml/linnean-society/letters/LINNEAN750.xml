            <abstract><p>Thanks for Smith's letter of 22 September. By Smith's account Lord Mountnorris [George Annesley] "a very much injured man"; recalls how unkind people, including Sir Joseph Banks' and [Thomas] Marsham, were twenty-four years ago [in 1796 Annesley won damages from John Bellenden Gawler (1764-1842), soldier, for committing adultery with his wife]. Agrees it necessary to supporting Sir Humphry Davy for Royal Society presidency, recalls how it suffered in the contest between Banks and [Samuel] Horsley [(1733-1806), bishop of St Asaph].</p><p>Does not agree with Smith's disapproval of the proceedings taken against the Queen [Caroline (1768-1821), wife of George IV] and believes that if even a small part of the allegations against her are true it leaves her unsuitable for elevated rank. Thinks Banks' peculiar attitude caused by his extensive travels, observing that travellers in Asia often return "neutralised in their notions of religion" so that Banks', after being interested in such a variety of people, objects, and events, became regardless of any. Would be happy to see "Flora Britannica" finished. The Dean of Carlisle, [Robert] Hodgson, a "zealous botanist". A recently arrived Italian has assured him that Italy is not angry with the Queen for anything except that she should not have engaged with such "a very low fellow as Bergami" [Bartolomeo Bergami, or Pergami, a pretended Milanese baron who became her courier, bodyguard, groom of the bedchamber, and major-domo].</p></abstract>
