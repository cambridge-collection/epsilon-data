            <abstract><p>Prevented by gout from reviewing Smith's papers; it was caused by his horse plunging into an unexpected hole whilst crossing a river at Old Windsor, Berkshire. Smith "deep in the willows": he thinks they should be described in the two states of fructification and leaf; agrees that 'Salix amygdalina' and 'S. triandra' are the same, having seen it in Bath and on Battersea fields with different leaves but the same bark; found 'Salix rubra fissa' Hoffmann in a holt on the north side of Ely, Cambridgeshire, and not on Prickwillow Bank; wanted to add the habitat of Walmer Castle and Deal, Kent, to 'S. arenaria' but not sure of Smith's plant; glad that Smith has thrown out 'S. hermaphroditica'. Does not follow Smith's 'Polypodium': thought they found 'P. thelypteris' near Bury but Smith has listed it as 'P. oreopteris'; asks how Smith has addressed 'P. aculeatum' and 'P. lobatum' on account of how different they appeared in [William] Sole's garden.</p></abstract>
