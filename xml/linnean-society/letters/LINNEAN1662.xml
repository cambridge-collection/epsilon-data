            <abstract><p>Accouunt of a dinner at William Smith's. Attending Linnean Society anniversary meeting. Lord Valentia [George Annesley] has given him many new shells. His future plans, including visits to Blackheath, and giving 6 more lectures, ending on 14 June.</p><p>Account of Linnean Society anniversary meeting; [Richard] Salisbury and others did not vote; the dinner attended by 63 people, the largest number yet, including Bishops of Winchester and Carlisle [respectively Brownlow North and Samuel Goodenough], Lord Valentia [George Annesley], Sir Abraham Hume, Sir Thomas Gage, and [John] Symmons. A toast was made to him by Valentia, stating that whatever the Linnean Society is or has been is owed to Smith, and he presented Goodenough and [Thomas] Marsham as being with him the first 3 projectors of the Society.</p><p>Visited Sir Joseph Banks this morning and was discussing botany with [Jonas] Dryander and [Robert] Brown when Salisbury entered; his "Paradisus [Londinensis]" stopped for want of money, though Banks gave Hooker Â£50; spoke civilly to Salisbury at Linnean Society about a 'Narcissus' that was there; Salisbury looks thin and pale, and Brown "cannot abide him". Thinks his and [James] Sowerby's new work will proceed; details. His "Introduction [to Botany]" praised by all the people he most depends on. Attended opera with [James] Crowe and family. Future visits to Blackheath and Kew; [William Townsend] Aiton was at the dinner.</p><p>Letter scented with balm of Gilad.</p></abstract>
