            <abstract><p>Received Winch's letter of 1 June [1810] via [James] Sowerby; uncertain whether it was lost in his "multifarious museum". He has been working on the 'Lichen' part of his fourth volume [of "Flora Britannica"] but cannot begin it for the press until [William Jackson] Hooker comes to a conclusion with his 'Jungermanniae' ["British Jungermanniae" (1816)].</p><p>Numbered observations on Winch's plants: 1. 'Lichen rupestris'; 2. 'L. pruinosus'; 3. 'Hypnum rugosum'; 4. 'Gymnostonum'; 5-9. marked doubtfully by [Dawson] Turner, not confident of any of them. Uncertain who told them that 'Pyrola media' was found at Studley, [Warwickshire]; they must always be on guard against such erroneous information and mistaken species; determined to admit nothing into the sequel to his "Flora" of which he has not a specimen himself to examine and keep as an authority. 11. 'Chironia littoralis'; 12. a 'Juncus', possibly his 'J. maritimus'; 13. 'J. campestris'; 14. 'Agrostis fascicularis' Curtis; 'A. pumila', does not think it a species.</p><p>Turner, Hooker, and himself all "truly concerned" that Winch should have any "gloom" in his prospects, and hope they soon brighten.</p><p>[On recto of second folio] List of 15 plants sent 10 June 1810, corresponds with Smith's observations above [in Winch's hand].</p></abstract>
