            <abstract><p>Replies to Roscoe's letter of 25 July. Spent a month at Lowestoft, [Suffolk], with family of his wife [Pleasance Smith]; she and [William Fitt] Drake have both regained their health following seabathing, and on return to Norwich they saw the Kindersleys. His sister [Fanny] now in Liverpool and is happy in the connections she has formed, hopes Roscoe has met her. Looking forward to his lectures in Liverpool next summer, for which he has prepared a new course of lectures. Plans to dedicate "Exotic Botany" to Roscoe, due to appear 1 December. Asks if Roscoe has seen Captain [Thomas] Hardwicke; Smith sent seeds of his to Roscoe. Hopes [John] Shepherd [(c 1764-1836, curator Liverpool Botanic Garden] sent Lady [Amelia] Hume and Mr Cooper of Norwich the plants he promised. Asks Shepherd to prepare a collection of uncommon Botany Bay, Cape, and West Indies seeds to be sent to the Empress in France [Joséphine de Beauharnais (1763-1814), wife of Napoléon Bonaparte] and requests confidentiality, though it it will be sent publicly through the Trade Office. Hopes his sister gave Shepherd the "parrot tulip" bulb._x000D_</p><p>Asks Roscoe's opinion of the criticism Smith's "Flora [Britannica]" received in November edition of the "Monthly Magazine". Asks after progrerss on Roscoe's "[Life and Pontificate of] Leo [the Tenth]", informs him of progress of [Thomas] Johnes' translation of Froissart [(c 1337-c 1405), French chronicler]. Working on "Prodromus Florae Graecae" this month. Recommends Sims' and Konig's "Annals of Botany", to which he intends to send a paper on the "Decandrous Papilionaceous plants of New Holland"; believes he has found a way to classify them. Encloses part of 'Humea elegans'.</p></abstract>
