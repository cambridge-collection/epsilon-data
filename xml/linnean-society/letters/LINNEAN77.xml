            <abstract><p>Disappointed to see 18 people at the Linnean Society at recent evening meeting, "a very large number for a private night", account of the balloting: Smith's friend [Robert John] Thornton [(c 1768-1837)] rejected with three blackballs, and two blackballs each against [James Webbe] Tobin [(d 1814)] and Revd [Henry Peter] Stacey, which is a new system they are starting; [Samuel] Goodenough's motion received 14 votes to 3 against, and [William] Pilkington's [(1758-1848)] amendment received 3 votes to 14. Lists those in attendance. Society business. Has since been informed that more people would have attended and blackballed Thornton had they known he was proposed.</p><p>Goodenough found 'Salix rubra' but [William] Curtis lost both cuttings and specimens.</p></abstract>
