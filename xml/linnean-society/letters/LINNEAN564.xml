            <abstract><p>Mr Walker has arrived at Oxford, unfortunately the scholarship he enquired after will be occupied for some time but it is noted he has "more discretion than his unfortunate father and [...] his very ingenious but most indiscreet relative already resident". Sorry he missed Smith in London, had a severe illness in the spring which has caused the [Oxford Botanic] Garden to suffer but thanks Smith for the seeds. Received a copy of "Flora Graeca" for the Radcliffe library; the Bodleian Library have declined to purchase a copy in part due to expense, recent heavy expenditure on manuscripts, and conviction that [John] Sibthorp's executors will gift a copy anyway. Actions of the executors of Sibthorp's will respecting money. Does not believe the Bodleian will make any more natural history acquisitions.</p></abstract>
