            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter and enclosure of [Casper von] Voght's letter to Smith; his prices for wine are very satisfactory. Sorry Mr Gurney made so short a stay as he liked him and his family very much. Dr [James] Anderson's health very indifferent. Received a "very handsome" letter from [Thomas] Pennant enclosing one to Anderson. [Richard] Warner [(1763-1857), antiquary] as "rapid a publisher as he is a walker" and expects an account of his summer travels next spring [he visited Hafod], though did not like the company he brought with him. Advises Smith to hasten publication of his own "Tour" in case he is forestalled.</p><p>Many of his Russian seeds have come up. They have had finest harvest weather possible but fears incoming rain, hopes it clears before [Richard Payne] Knight [(1750-1824), classicist] visit, who has just lost his mother. Also expecting [Charles Howard, 11th] Duke of Norfolk [(1746-1815)] shortly. His "poor girl" [daughter, Mariamne Johnes] goes on "much as usual", and Dr [David] Davies and Mr Williams think her general health recovered: her back is flatter but tumour remains and she cannot walk in spite of constantly wearing Jones' machine and though they hear of many recovering "we seem to stand still". Fears French gaining "a foothold in Ireland". Asks if Smith has read [William] Eton's "Survey of Turkey", which has greatly amused him, "what rascals they must be!".</p></abstract>
