            <abstract><p>Comments on Smith's Latinity in the "Flora Graeca" and justifies his use of "etc." for saving the trouble of listing every author of authority who has written on Greek flora. Advice on the delination of [John] Sibthorp's name. Small alteration to title page, and to the title of "Prodromus Florae Graecae".</p><p>Longs to hear when Smith will be in London. Attended Linnean Society meeting in March, "where to my astonishment, [Richard] Salisbury presented his printed squib against "E[nglish] Botany", ["Generic characters of "English Botany"]". Does not believe [William George] Maton, who was in the chair, should have allowed it to be read. [James] Dickson, [Thomas] Marsham, [Alexander] Macleay, and Sir T[homas Gery] Cullum were all of Goodenough's opinion that the Linnean Society "was not the arena on which any of its members ought to engage". [Jonas] Dryander also agrees with Goodenough. Pointed out to several fellows the weakness and impotency of the attack.</p></abstract>
