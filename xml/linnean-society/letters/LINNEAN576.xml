            <abstract><p>Busy with the National Schools for the Education of the Poor. Received Smith's shilling in the post and notes it was not tampered with; wishes others were as careful as Smith in ensuring their correspondence is not chargeable to the recipient, as the "vain-glorius Lancaster" [probably John Lancaster (1778-1838), Quaker and public education innovator] did to him in sending a copy of his "seditious" speech in Ireland and an Irish newspaper. Refuses to join the Linnean Dining Club as he does not wish to have his carriage waiting so publicly outside the British Coffee House, the chosen venue for it. Unsurprised to read that "riot &amp; robbery stalk abroad uncontrolled", and even expected it considering how the upcoming generation of men educated upon Lancaster's plan were kept from religious notions and now have a "very general indifference with respect to all religion". No Linnean Society news, [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert "enamoured of being in the Chair". Currently preparing two arduous sermons.</p></abstract>
