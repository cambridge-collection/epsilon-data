            <abstract><p>Laments [James] Currie [(1756-1805), physician and author] and Clarke, who both died shortly after Smith left Liverpool. Remarks on positive change in character of his son, James, following his return to Allerton after long absence [training under Samuel Taylor of Norfolk, farmer]. Thanks for Smith's letter of observations and specimens; convinced his system will withstand criticism but has struggled to write dissertation on it.</p><p>Has learnt via [William Fitt] Drake that after receiving a "very violent" letter from [Richard] Salisbury, Smith has terminated all further intercourse; [Roscoe] glad Salisbury has shown himself publically, thus making the split justifiable and proper.</p><p>Reports on unexpected docking of "The Investigator" at Liverpool on way to Plymouth, and encounter with the two naturalists [Robert] Brown and [Ferdinand] Bauer [(1760-1826), botanical artist]; their collections could not be opened or seen but informed they found only one Scitamineae, an 'Alpinia'. Smith has a start on them with "Exotic botany".</p><p>Postscript on left-hand side of verso of first folio: returns "valuable specimen" of the "Arur. Cardamom", keeping the other specimens for present.</p></abstract>
