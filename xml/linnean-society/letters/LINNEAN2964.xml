            <abstract><p>Has been kept busy attending to county business, believes "in these perilous times [...] it is the duty of everyone to put a hand to the plough" [threat of invasion by Napoleon]. Would like to meet [William] Roscoe. Hopes that the people will change their attitudes to the war, "as they grow wiser in science so they may in politics &amp; learn the true [difference] between justice and tyranny". Would like a particular account of Forster's herbarium. Letter from [Alexander von] Humboldt and [Aim√©] Bonpland in Peru in most recent number of "Annals de Museum National", they have collected 3000-4000 specimens. Milne [(fl 1800s-1810s) William Beckford's gardener] has informed him that Beckford wishes Smith to see [Fonthill] Abbey and all its improvments, "the only person that has that permission, even the Duke of Norfolk [...] was refused". Shocked by news from Ireland [a rebellion in Dublin]. Impressed with [William] Turton's [(1762-1835), conchologist] "Syst. Veg.". 'Leea crispa' growing well in his stove. All of [William] Roxburgh's plants growing well.</p></abstract>
