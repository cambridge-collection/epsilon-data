            <abstract><p>Sorry to have not met Smith at Liverpool, Lancashire. Alarm of possible invasion, hopes that a compromise may soon be reached between the "two hostile governments" [presumably Britain and France]. Condolence on death of Mr Taylor, commiserates by relating how much he has been affected by the recent death of a close friend, [Mangin]. The burdens of a long life, religion his only consolation, does not feel Dr Johnson's horror of the idea of non-existence. Believes that the Irish Courts of Justice not being permitted to do any business next term shows the government is alarmed by the prospect of a French invasion, and although it would be easier for them to invade England they will meet with many more friends in Ireland. Has heard there is a "pleasing litterary society" in Liverpool, where he has been staying. Also met [William] Roscoe, complimentary towards Dr Currie. Saw multiple 'Xeranthemum' had by a lady from the Cape.</p></abstract>
