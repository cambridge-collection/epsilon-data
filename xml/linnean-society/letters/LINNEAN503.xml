            <abstract><p>Received Smith's letter and Linnean Society diploma. [Gregory] Boraston briefly visited him, has given him a copy of [Pier Antonio] Micheli's [(1679-1737)] 60 plates ["Icones plantarum submarinarum"] for Smith. Brief history of Micheli's work: it was intended for second volume with "Nova Genera", and Tozzetti's father [Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti] attempted to separate the zoophita from the plants after Micheli's death. Plans to publish the unpublished parts, may ask Smith for assitance. Also sending with Boraston his memoir on 'Lathyrus sativus', many additional observations can be made and adds that after Mr Visconti had for some time been fed a small amount of the seeds of it and lost the use of his legs. Visconti eventually died and at his dissection it was discovered he was suffering from advanced synovitis in the joints and his bones had become so soft that they could be cut with a knife.</p></abstract>
