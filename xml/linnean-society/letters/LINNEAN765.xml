            <abstract><p>Since the death his daughter, Mrs Charlotte Lynn, Mr Lynn has not tried for pupils nor attempted to find a matron to superintend the management and education of his children. Praises character of the King [George IV (1762-1830)], who "has only to shew himself &amp; everyone must admire him", and blames his previous foolish practices on his tutors the Bishop of Worcester and Dr Arnold. Dislikes the "idle rumours" about the attempt or design to assassinate the Duke of Wellington [Arthur Wellesley (1769-1852), soldier and statesman]. Wonders the true reason for [Thomas William] Coke giving up his agicultural meetings; [John Christian] Curwen [(1756-1828)], a great agiculturist in Cumberland, has given up his political agricultural meetings after being elected for the county, his chief aim.</p><p>Goodenough's observations on insects and birds: there have been no wasps this year compared to the multitudes last year which ate all their fruit; the last swifts left at the beginning of August, and last week during violent storms no swallows or martins were seen but with calmer skies they have returned, in fewer numbers, having already arrived late and less numerous than usual.</p></abstract>
