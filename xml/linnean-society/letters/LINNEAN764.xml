            <abstract><p>Obliged to the Smiths for their condolences following the death of his daughter, Mrs Charlotte Lynn. She had nearly recovered from her long troubles with chest disorders and dangerous inflammations by taking extract of hemlock but was taken ill after drinking a glass of cold water following an exerting walk and never recovered. She has left twelve children between ages of sixteen years and six months. Two months ago he received and ignored a letter from Smith's sister, Mrs Lloyd, complaining of her husband's, Dr Lloyd, and Smith's confinement of her. Relieved that the King [George IV (1762-1830)] did not come via Carlisle on his way to or from Scotland. Thinks the current session of Parliament has gone on long enough and does not approve of the new principle of bringing every complaint, well or ill-founded, before it.</p></abstract>
