            <abstract><p>Responds to Mrs P's letter. Religion "seems to sit very easy upon every body here"; disinclined to judge other people's conduct on the subject, less charity for those who have "scarcely any true principles of religion [and] in private affect to despise all those who have more principle or diffidence". His hatred of Abbés, though knows some exceptions, shocked that people entrust the education of their children to them, when their celibacy means these men cannot be anything but dissolute.</p><p>General dislike of the ladies of Paris and their painted faces; expects to fall in love with the first English woman he meets on landing, actually felt himself in danger from an English woman he saw in Paris. Nuns who visit the sick make up for the Abbés. Enquired after medical education abroad but not impressed with French system.</p><p>To Mr [Pitchford]: looking over Tournefort's herbarium, has already described 50 new species of oriental plants from it.</p></abstract>
