            <abstract><p>Sorry Sir James [Edward Smith] could not visit him in Bury following his own visit to Smith in Saxmundham; hopes his health is recovering. Lady Cullum's trip to Brighton did not revive her health; she is now taking ass's milk to prevent "an irregular &amp; teazing intermittent fever". His son and daughter-in-law staying in Pisa so she can treated by the "celebrated Dr Vacca", but as the baths of Bar√®ges, [France], and Sorrento, [Italy], doubts the worth of this. Death of Sir William Watson [(1744-1824), physician and naturalist]; recalls that when he stayed in Bath he would meet at Governor Pounal's house with Sir William, Dr Parry, [Thomas] Velley, [John] Stackhouse, Sir Thomas Frankland, Archbishop of York [William Markham (1719-1807)], and Dr Falkner, reminded of death of Sir Joseph Banks and the loss of a place where so many friends would meet together.</p></abstract>
