            <abstract><p>Disappointed by trip to Ramsgate, [Kent], and only stayed fourteen days; also visited Dover, [Kent], but too old to climb hills for 'Brassica oleracea'. Dr [Pelham] Warren [(1778-1835)] prescribed for Lady Cullum two grains of James's powder and two of rhubarb taken nightly, and neutral saline draughts. Attended Horticultural Society meeting; few in attendance but pines, grasses, peaches, and cherries dealt out. Called on a busy [Robert] Brown in Soho Square. Accusations against [Richard] Salisbury in the newspapers; he is to appear at the Old Bailey though Cullum imagines he will flee to Italy where his charges are "scarce reckoned any crime", informed he has resigned membership of Linnean, Royal, and Horticultural Societies. Thanks for plants of 'Lathyrus grandiflorus'. Comments on produce and prices at Covent Garden market produce, including gourds, Siberian crabs, elder berries, walnuts, and sloes; recalls when he importuned [James] Dickson to give an account of everything sold in the market with their names, uses, and prices.</p></abstract>
