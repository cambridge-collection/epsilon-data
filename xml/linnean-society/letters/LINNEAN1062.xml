            <abstract><p>Informed of Smith's illness by his "new &amp; valuable correspondent", [James] Brodie. Regrets that any dispute "should have arisen with a man who having proved himself capable of premeditated, &amp; continued, deceit must have ever remained a charatcer for mistrust" [presumably a reference to Richard Salisbury's dispute with Smith]. Recommended Loudon to Mr Price of Foxley as he was going into that neighbourhood, but Price objects to much of Loudon's book.</p><p>Wrote paper for Linnean Society testifying [William] Hudson's "Flora Anglica" in response to so many of the marine plants in "English Botany" not conforming with Hudson's. Received 'Pyrola uniflora', the last he wanted, from Brodie. His only botanical neighbour, Archdeacon Pierson, has died of pleurisy in very bad circumstances; his herbarium of 1500 English and 2000 exotic dried plants on paper 18 inches by 12 to be sold at York, he would always go back and improve his specimens whenever he found better.</p></abstract>
