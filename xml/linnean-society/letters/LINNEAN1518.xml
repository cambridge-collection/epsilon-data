            <abstract><p>Thanks for "[Botany of] New Holland" and specimens; glad to hear a second fasciculus is printing and a third "Icones [pictae]" will appear. Hopes death of Smith's brother, Richard, was natural, though knowing his situation and "perverseness" had his doubts and fears. Envies Smith his visit to Dr [Nichola] Gwyn in Ipswich, [Suffolk], and Harwich, [Essex]; finding of a 'Mentha' a "very capital discovery", should figure in "English botany", will inform [John] Pitchford, though doubts he will get through his mints. Gave [David Elisha] Davy Smith's specimen of 'Satyrium', as requested, does not grow near Bungay. Glad to see 'Linum tenuifolium'; distinct from their plant and specimens of wild 'L. angustifolium'.</p><p>Agrees to [Edmund] Davall's proposal to exchange specimens. Glad to hear of safe return of [Adam] Afzelius and Fran√ßois [Borone]. Has been studying 'Fucus abrotanifolius', 'F. foeniculaceus', and 'F. concatenatus'; detailed observations of each and character descripton of 'F. abrotanifolius'. Heard Smith is visiting Lady Rockingham and other botanical friends before returning to Frogmore [lecturing the Queen and Princesses]. Sends specimen of unknown plant picked at Lowestoft, [Suffolk] [Smith has annotated 'Spergula nodosa'].</p></abstract>
