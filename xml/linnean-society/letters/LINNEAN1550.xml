            <abstract><p>Given a frank by the Duke of Gloucester [Prince William (1776-1834), chancellor of Cambridge University]. Ambivalent about his return to Norwich, [Norfolk]. Thanks for note about the Master family. Met [William] and Mrs Hooker at Liverpool, and Simon Wilkin. Received a "most kind sensible" letter from sister Francis [widow of Smith's brother], who can live on what they have but is reluctant to give up the trade for the sake of her sons. Also received a letter from Frederick [Smith's brother], in financial difficulties. His high opinion of Lord Anson [Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson (1767-1818)]. [Thomas] Marsham recovering but his affairs in bad order owing to his son's extravagance._x000D_</p><p>He has been free of headaches but his "fat or fulness" unaffected by travelling. Richard Kindersley [Smith's cousin] has attained his fellowship. Duke of Gloucester and Blackwells send their compliments.</p></abstract>
