            <abstract><p>His lectures ended on 4 June; the last very well attended and applauded, even though it was entirely without preparation. His time here with Sir William and Lady East; her liver complaint. They are to visit the Marquis of Blandford [George Spencer-Churchill]. [Thomas] Velley killed on Sunday at Reading by jumping from an out of control coach; if he had stayed seated he would have lived. Norwich paving bill past in House of Lords, with opposition.</p><p>His lectures have not lost any credit and he has been engaged again for next spring. Resolved to publish an "introductory book" on botany before next spring; fears Mrs [Jane] Barrington will not live to receive the dedication. Happy Dr [Henry] Reeve is to settle in Norwich. William with him [Smith's brother?].</p></abstract>
