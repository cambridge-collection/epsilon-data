Intends to write to Dr [George] Thackery, new vice-chancellor of Cambridge, regarding garden and lectureship, which if he gains he will enter the university and if not remain as he is, as advised the Bishop of Bristol [William Mansel]. The Dean [of Norwich, Joseph Turner (1747-1828)] says that the university cannot avoid offering the professorship to Smith and if they do he should be offered an MA without entering. Invites the Cullums, [Aylmer Bourke] Lambert and Mrs Lochee to them instead. Dr Davy dying of a cancerous disorder in the mouth at Dr Tuthill's, Soho Square, a great loss.</p><p>In postscript addressed to Lambert invites him and Mrs Lochee to Norwich whilst Roscoe is staying; they cannot alter their day of going to Holkham as they are engaged to meet the Duke of Gloucester [Prince William (1776-1834), chancellor of Cambridge University], with whom Roscoe is well acquainted.</p></abstract>
