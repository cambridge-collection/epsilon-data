            <abstract><p>Thanks for the two copies of third volume of "Flora Britannia"; humbled by the "deference you have paid to my humble attempts at the genus 'Carex'". Has just heard that there is a "lady botanist" at Rochester; regrets that both at Windsor and Rochester there were no naturalists, "this horrid war turns all men's minds to drums, trumpets &amp; arms". Will try to attend the Linnean Society anniversary meeting but wishes for his resignation of the vice-presidentship to take place before then. Praises Smith's support of "English Botany", thinks the variety of 'Hedypnois autumnalis' is a distinct species. Unsure of 'Picris hieracoides'; always thought it a one foot high dwarfish plant and cannot find it in "English Botany" and has been told by Eton botanists that it is a smooth plant growing over the ferry in a lane in Datchet, Berkshire, about three feet high. Encouraging his and [John] Sibthorp's acquaintance, Miss [Elizabeth] Hill [(c 1760-1850), algologist], to study marine plants. Dr Walter Vaughan, an old friend of Smith's from Edinburgh and Leiden, has established a practice in Rochester and "threatens" to take up botany in the summer. Goodenough's wife a "sad invalid".</p></abstract>
