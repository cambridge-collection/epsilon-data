            <abstract><p>Smith's trip to Hafod, Cardiganshire, pleasant except for [Mariamne] Johnes disorder; fortunate that Smith's was there to diagnose and suggest best treatment; Mrs Woodward's cousin of 17 years old suffered from similar affliction and made long but successful recovery following Mr Potto's method.</p><p>Smith's East Anglian friends rejoice at his intention to settle in Norwich, [Norfolk]. Received 'Bellium bellioides' of [James] Crowe's garden from [John] Pitchford; a new British genus. Asks after [Dawson] Turner's admittance to the Linnean Society.</p><p>Received [William] Withering's new edition [of "An arrangement of British plants"]; "very much improved" in arrangement and matter; [Samuel] Goodenough's assistance with 'Carex', [Hugh] Davies' with mosses, and [Thomas] Velley's and [John] Stackhouse's with 'Fucus', including some not in his and Goodenough's paper, as they did not want to supersede them. Requests specimens or view of [Adam] Afzelius' American 'Fucus' species, so they can be described.</p></abstract>
