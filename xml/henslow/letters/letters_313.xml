            <p>Apologises that JSH has not been able to see fossil spike in London, potentially a large <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium</hi>, because it cannot be transported due to fragility. Provides a description and drawing of it.</p>
                <p>Discusses fossil trees found in his local area and specimens sent to the Geological Society and Robert Brown, together with a paper Bowman has written on them. States that he has found proof of the solid and subsequently hollowed state of the trees from corresponding bands of soft shale. Provides JSH with a brief description and says full details will be given when whole paper is published. States that they give decisive proof of growth where they were found, that they have overturned the scepticism of geologists including John Phillips and Louis Agassiz, and that a miniature model is being made of them.</p>
            <p>Discusses illustrations of the internal structure of <hi rend="italic">Sigillaria</hi> by Alexandre Brongniart and his wish to see them when published. Also discusses previous drawings of <hi rend="italic">Sigillaria</hi> with leaves by Brongniart and W. Conway. Passes on message from Conway for <hi rend="italic">Fossil Flora</hi> to send someone to do drawings of Bristol fossil collection.</p>
