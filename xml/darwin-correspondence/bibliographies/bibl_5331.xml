    <bibl>Mayer, Alfred Marshall. 1874–5. Researches in acoustics.—No. V. <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> 4th ser. 48 (1874): 266–274, 371–85, 445–52; (1875) 513–25.</bibl>
    <idno>Online: from October, November, December 1874 and January 1875, though the online version is confusing and puts the last (special?) issue in January 1874 rather than January 1875. His series of papers on acoustics spans decades so I have just done entry for no. 5.</idno>
