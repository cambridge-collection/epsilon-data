    <idno>MA.14.85 NC.  For publication details of the parts see front and endpapers bound at back. [NB it is eccentric to use part publication details (which are rarely available) rather than title/imprint page (which has 1882) but I don't see the point in arguing. Use this rather than Weismann 1882 in future. SE.]</idno>
