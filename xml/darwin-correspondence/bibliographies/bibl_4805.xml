    <bibl>Linnaeus, Carolus (Carl von Linné). 1785–90. <hi rend="italic">Amoenitates academicae.</hi> 3d edition. 10 vols. Erlangen: Jacob Palm.</bibl>
    <idno>CCD.47.233–42; I think these volumes in UL’s Rare Books include the 2d ed. which is all I have to look at here, but the pagination does match the letter text. SD Comparing Swedish Wikipedia page with Newton record (actually 1749–90) it seems that in the UL copy, vol. 1 is 1st ed.; vol. 2 is 1st ed. or possibly 2d: Newton gives it two different dates and editions, the date of 2d ed disagrees with Wikipedia but it may be reprint; vols. 3–7 are probably 1st ed., though 3 is rather early for that according to Wiki; 8 and 9 are 1st ed.; 10 is 1st ed. According to Wiki only vol. 2 has a 3d ed. (1787); the second edition (vols. 1–7) is 1762–89, starting with vol. 2 in 1762. SE.</idno>
