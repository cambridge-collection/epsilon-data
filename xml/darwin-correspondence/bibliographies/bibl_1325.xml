    <bibl>Caton, John Dean. 1868. <hi rend="italic">American Cervus.</hi> Read before the Ottawa Academy of Natural Sciences, 21 May 1868. Ottawa, Illinois: Osman and Hapeman.</bibl>
    <idno>DAR Pam G523. I can find no record of the Transactions of the Ottawa Academy.... (sent out 2 queries, and not in WorldCat), and find that Caton’s paper was published as the book above (2 worldwide according to WorldCat), though CD does have an offprint. It was also published in Caton 1880, pp. 146–7, which is what I referred to in footnotes. SD. Looking at WorldCat I infer that the ‘book’ is the offprint: they are identical. SE.</idno>
