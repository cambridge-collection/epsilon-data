    <idno>NC MB.45.82. not on shelf when I looked, no card. But I assume euber in Library Search entry is a misprint for ueber. [It's über on WorldCat. ES]  Not on BHL and only later editions on archive.org. CD's copy is at Down. The English translation is in two vols: the first is the senses and the will, and the second is on the development of the intellect. But I don't have any evidence that the German book was also in two vols. </idno>
