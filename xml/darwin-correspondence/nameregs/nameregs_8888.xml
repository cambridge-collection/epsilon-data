    <note type="biography">
        <p>Russian zoologist. Schoolteacher in Odessa. Carried out research on the brine shrimp and published several works between 1872 and 1877. Suggested that the brine shrimp, <hi rend="italic">Artemia</hi>, could progressively transform into <hi rend="italic">Branchipus</hi> (the fairy shrimp) in low saline conditions. Attacked for godlessness as a result of his work, he was accused of stealing a lens from a microscope; committed suicide. His experimental work was heavily criticised from the 1890s onwards.</p></note>
