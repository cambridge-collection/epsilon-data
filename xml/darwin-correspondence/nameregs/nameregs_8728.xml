        <p>American geologist. After working for the Ohio State Geological Survey, became a senior geologist with the newly formed US Geological Survey in 1879. Considered one of the founders of geomorphology; recognised that landforms reflected a state of balance between the processes that acted upon them and the structure and composition of the rocks that composed them (dynamic equilibrium). Expounded this concept in his geological report on the Henry Mountains, Utah, 1877. </p>
