        <p>Dutch anatomist, microscopist, and physician. Author of a thesis on respiration and a book on the anatomy of the uterus. An opponent of the idea of spontaneous generation and metamorphosis in insects, he pioneered new techniques for microdissection that revealed both their internal anatomy and their stages of development. Much of his research was published posthumously.</p></note>
