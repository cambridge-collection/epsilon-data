        <p>Photographer. Née Pattle. Born in India, but spent much of her childhood in England and France. Became a friend of John Herschel’s in South Africa, where she went in 1835 to convalesce from an illness. Married Charles Hay Cameron in Calcutta in 1838, and acted as a social organiser and hostess for the governor-general of India, Lord Henry Hardinge, in the 1840s. The family returned to England in 1848, and moved to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, in 1860. Cameron took up photography in 1863; was elected to the Photographic Society of London, 1864, and organised her first solo exhibition in 1865. She exhibited regularly in Europe. Emigrated to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) with her husband in 1875.</p></note>
