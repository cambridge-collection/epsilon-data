            <p>Thereza Story-Maskelyne nee Llewelyn (1834-1926) was the daughter of John Dillwyn Llewelyn, the first photographer in Wales. Like her father, Thereza enjoyed photography; she helped her father with his scientific endeavours, including his photographic experiments. In her youth she also conducted botanic experiments, even receiving aid from George Bentham. Additionally, she maintained meteorological records from her father’s weather station.</p> 
            <p>She was married to English geologist and politician Nevil Story-Maskelyne in June 1858. Her husband was supportive of her scientific endeavours: he even wrote to John Lubbock to ask if Darwin would be willing to send Thereza copies of two texts for use in her botanical studies. Darwin responded to this request and sent the Maskelynes a couple of memoirs, as evidenced by a thank you note Nevil Maskelyne sent on behalf of his wife, who was an invalid at the time. Thereza wrote about both photography and astronomy. Darwin was aware of observations she made of her canary and siskin attacking flowers: he cited her observations in an 1874 <hi rend="italic">Nature </hi>article.</p>
