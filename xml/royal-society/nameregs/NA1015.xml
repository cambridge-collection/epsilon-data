      <p>Profession: Diplomat</p>
      <p>Career: Portuguese Ambassador to United Kingdom in London (1739), then to Austria in Vienna (1745). On the recommendation of Marie Anne (Josephine) mother of Joseph I King of Portugal, Pombal became Prime Minister of Portugal (1750) and undertook many modenrizing policies. He showed great resourcefulness after the terrble earthquake on All Saints Day 1755 in replanning the city of Lisbon, two thirds of which had ben devastated by a tidal wave, killing some 30,000 people. Fell from office on accession of Maria i and Pedro III, joint rulers 1777-86. Maria opposed some fo his reforms and Pombal was condemned to death after a grotesque trial, but was then pardoned, though expelled from Lisbon. Freemason, member yet unknown London Lodge St John's Day [presumably 24 June] 1744, while Portuguese Ambassador to London.</p>
