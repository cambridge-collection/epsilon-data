      <p>Smeathman was a business man, but his interests spread to the study of termites, on which topic he presented a paper to the Royal Society in 1781. He had also spent three years in the 1770's in the Banana Islands off the coast of Sierra Leone, collecting botanical samples for Sir Joseph Banks's collection at Kew. Smeathman had witnessed the Parisian balloon ascents in 1783 and - critical of the Montgolfier brothers wayward flights - had set down in a letter to Banks in February 1784 a radical change in design, from a globular balloon shape to an elongated horizontal form with wings. In Smeathmans' words 'a dirigible aerostatic machine' capable of alighting on both land and water. A letter from George Cumberland dated 4 March 1784 was sent to Joseph Banks which included illustrations (see Archived Papers) Banks however was unconvinced by Smeathman's designs. In his reply to Cumberland, dated 6 March 1784, Banks stated that any attempt to guide the aerostat by its wings would be hazardous. Furthermore, Smeathman's letter to February 1784 - with its plea to Banks to request British government help to aid the construction - went unanswered. Smeathman's designs never left the page, far less the ground, and he died in 1787.</p>
