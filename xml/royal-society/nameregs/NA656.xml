      <p>Notes: Known as Viscount Elveden, which became his courtesy title in the year in which his father was created Earl of Iveagh and Viscount Elveden, from 1919 until 1927, when he succeeded to his father's principal title. Index to BR includes amongst his honours 3 titles which were betowed upon his father: Bt 1885, Baron 1891 and Viscount Iveagh 1905. These have therefore been omitted from the Honours field above, as has the title of Viscount Elveden, which was a hereditary courtesy title rather than a sovereign's honour.</p>
