      <p>Notes: The obituary in the Proceeding of the Royal Society, 1839 incorrectly lists the name of the deceased Fellow as Edmund Law Lushington who was in fact the son of Edward Henry Lushington FRS. The biographical details correctly relate to E H Lushington and the correct name is given in the list of deceased Fellows at the beginning of the volume.</p>
