      <p>References: Malcolm Brown, 'How Not to "Regain Paradise": Henry Bellenden Ker, FRS from 1819 to 1831' in NR 1996 vol 50 pp 211-215</p>
      <p>Notes: In R he is listed simply as Henry Bellenden Ker. In DNB he is said to have resigned in 1830, but according to index to BR, this is wrong and he was expelled for arrears in 1831 - M.C.1 348 and CM 9 Jun 1831 are cited as sources.</p>
