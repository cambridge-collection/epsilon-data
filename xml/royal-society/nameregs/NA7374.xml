      <p>Notes: Proposed by Sir Hans Sloane. Hunter gives a tentative identification, though he admits it is unlikely. Printed list (1698-1703) calls him 'Ds Balthazar Becker [Becher] MD', but JBC vol 9 p92 states that 'Dr Christopher Becker' was proposed 18 May 1698 by Sloane, JBC vol 9 p101 'Dr Becker' elected, CMC vol 2 pp132-3 'Dr Becker' approved 11 May 1698 and elected 6 July 1698</p>
      <p>Hirsch has a Daniel Christoph Beckher or Becker (1658-1691), son and grandson of doctors, who travelled for several years through Germany France, Italy and England, was MD Utrecht (1684) and Professor of Medicine at Konigsberg (1686). It seems possible that this Christopher (or Balthasar) Becker was his son.</p>
