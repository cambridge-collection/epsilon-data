      <p>Notes: On PL for 1796 but not after. No announcement of death in JB. DNB says that 'one John Mills died at Glanton, Northumberland, 8 Nov 1786', although states that he probably died in 1784 (on the grounds that he appeared on the list of the French Agricultural Society up until 1784).</p>
