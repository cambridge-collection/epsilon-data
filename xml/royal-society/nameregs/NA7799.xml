      <p>Notes: De Vic was not re-elected after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. He is therefore not considered an original Fellow of the Royal Society, a classification reserved for those named in the second charter of the Society granted in 1663, or elected within the following two month period stipulated therein for the declaration of Fellows. I.e the original Fellows are only those who were officially declared at the meetings of 20 May 1663 and 22 June 1663, elections like De Vic's that predated these meetings were no longer recognised.</p>
      <p>Date given as election date is date he was admitted.</p>
