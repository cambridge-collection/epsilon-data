      <p>Alexander Pitfield (1658-1728) was the son and heir of Sir Charles Pitfield of Shoreditch and Dorset. Sir Charles owned much of Hoxton, Pitfield Street there still exists today. Alexander was educated at Merchant Taylor's School, Charterhouse and Hoxton. He studied at Sidney College, Cambridge. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1684. He was MP for Bridport in Dorset from 1698 until his death. Alexander was the author of "A Natural History of the Animals" a beautiful book with many anatomical and other engravings. There are two copies in the British Library. As a result of later debts and marriages, the Hoxton estate passed into the family of the Sturts (later Lords Allington) and was finally auctioned off in 1917.</p>
