      <p>Notes: The election date is Powle's re-election date into the Society after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. All Fellows admitted in a two-month window after this charter, until 22 June 1663, are considered Original Fellows. He was previously mentioned as a member on 3 July 1661.</p>
      <p>Powle's activity within the Society decreased with monetary contributions reducing, possibly in part due to lack of meetings and centralised organisation of the Society during the Plague.</p>
