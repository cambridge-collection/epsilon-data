      <p>Notes: The election date is Ball's re-election date into the Society after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. All Fellows admitted in a two-month window after this charter, until 22 June 1663, are considered Original Fellows. He was present at the foundation meeting on 28 Nov 1660, which means he is considered one of the twelve Founder Fellows.</p>
