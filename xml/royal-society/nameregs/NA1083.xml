      <p>Notes: In JBC Dec 11 1766 is written: 'His Majesty the King of Poland was proposed from the Chair, and Elected by Ballot Unanimously, Fellow of the Society.' So the manner of his election would indicate Royal status; however he never signed the Royal, or indeed any, page of the Charter Book.</p>
