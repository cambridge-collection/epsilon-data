      <p>Notes: Disappeared from PL in 1855. In index to BR he is given a middle name spelt 'Colyer', although BR, cited as the only source, spells it 'Colyear'. Somerset has written on the election certificate: From an acquaintance of many years, I can strongly recommend him to the Society as deserving to be a member and likely to prove both valuable and useful to it</p>
