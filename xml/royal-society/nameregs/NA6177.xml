      <p>Notes: in the Printed List of Candidates 1915 to 1926 there is a Supplementary Certificate with the following citation: Since the outbreak of war Dr Dakin has devoted himself with conspicuous success to the antiseptic treatment of wounds, and published a series of monographs in which the application of a sodium hyochlorite preparation and the new antiseptic 'chloramine' is described (Brit Med Journ, Aug 28, Dec 4, 1915; Jan 15, 29, March 4, June 17, 1916). He has also introduced a new and convenient electrolytic cell for the preparation of hypochlorite from sea-water for disinfection of hospital ships (Journ RAMC, Feb, 1916). The proposers are: F S Hopkins; W M Bayliss; C J Martin; J B Cohen; A Harden; J S Haldane</p>
