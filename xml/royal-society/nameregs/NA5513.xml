      <p>Notes: Stuart was first proposed on 23 January 1661 but does not seem to have been formally elected until the date stated above (24 October 1667). Stuart is therefore not considered an original Fellow of the Royal Society, a classification reserved for those named in the 1663 charter or elected within the subsequent two months, the period allowed in the charter for the declaration of Fellows. Elections or proposals like Stuart's, which predated this were no longer recognised. The date of any subsequent re-election is given in this database as the official election date.</p>
