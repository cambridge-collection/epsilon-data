      <p>In a sale catalogue of the late Henry Fly by Benjamin Wheatley, auctioneer, ; 'A catalogue of a valuable theological and classical library, fine manuscripts, autograph letters, music, richly illuminated missals, etc of the late Rev. Henry Fly, D.D. F.R.S and F.A.S. Confessor of His Majesty's Household, St. James', Minister of Triity, in the Minories, and Vicar of Willesden, Midllesex...Which will be sold by auction by Mr. Wheatley, at his great room, 191, Piccadilly, on Monday 17th of March, 1834, and three following days...' it implies therefore that the Rev. Fly died at the end of 1833 or very early 1834.</p>
