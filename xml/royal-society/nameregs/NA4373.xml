      <p>Notes: He was the eldest son of Francis Greville, created Earl Brooke (1746) and Earl of Warwick (1759), who died 1773. So George Greville was initially known by the highest of his father's lesser titles, Baron Brooke, and it was as holder of this courtesy title that he was elected to the Society.</p>
