      <p>Asked in 1709 by the French government to find uses for spider silk, and demonstrated that it was useable for fabrics in the same manner as the silk of silkworms. Diligently collected the material from egg sacs of spiders, then had a large number of them washed, boiled and cleansed, then allowed to dry. Sacs were carded with fine combs and worked into slender thread of a pleasing grey colour. Two pairs of stockings and gloves made from this natural silk were presented to the 'Academie Royale des Sciences'. This accomplishment proved to be so sensational that in the following year the Academie commissioned Reamur to investigate the possibility of extensive uses of spider silk. After a thorough study however, he concluded that there was little likelihood that such spider silk as was available in Europe could become a profitable industry.</p>
