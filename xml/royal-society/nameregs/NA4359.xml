      <p>Notes: The election date is Fane's re-election date into the Society after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. All Fellows admitted in a two-month window after this charter, until 22 June 1663, are considered Original Fellows. He was previously elected and admitted into the Society on 1 October 1662.</p>
      <p>Expelled 25 Oct 1682 (Notes and Records).</p>
      <p>Hunter suggests FRS could be the dramatist Francis Fane (1635-1691) instead. Venn has a Francis Fane admitted to Emmanuel College Cambridge in 1653 and later admitted at Gray's Inn in 1655.</p>
