      <p>Notes: Le Neve suggests that it was his uncle, William Soame, son of Sir William Soame, who was knighted in 1674. He was admitted to Corpus Christi, Cambridge (1638) and married Katherine, daughter of William Wilson, merchant, of London. Burke says this William was the half-brother of the William who was Bart in 1684/5</p>
