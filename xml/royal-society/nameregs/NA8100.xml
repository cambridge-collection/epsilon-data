      <p>Notes: Alleyn did not sign the Society's first Charter book in May 1663 and died shortly after in June. The election date is Alleyn's re-election date into the Society after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. All Fellows admitted in a two-month window after this charter, until 22 June 1663, are considered Original Fellows. He was previously admitted into the Society on 15 May 1661.</p>
