      <p>Notes: Appears on PL up to 1695 but not after. Aubrey refers to him as Edmund Wylde MP 'a great patron of ingenious and good men for mere merit's sake', but he is not in Henning.</p>
      <p>The election date is Wylde's re-election date into the Society after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. All Fellows admitted in a two-month window after this charter, until 22 June 1663, are considered Original Fellows. He was previously elected on 16 January 1661.</p>
