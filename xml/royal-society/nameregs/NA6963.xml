   <note type="biography">
      <p>Birth: Salterhebble, near Halifax, Yorkshire, England (06 October 1735)</p>
      <p>Death: Brighton, Sussex (05 November 1800)</p>
      
      <p>Profession: Scientific instrument maker</p>
      <p>Research Field: Mathematics, optics, physics</p>
      <p>Career: Apprentice to a cloth worker, Halifax; apprentice to Mark Burton, mathematical instrument maker, Denmark Street, Strand, London (1758); worked in the Dollond workshop (early 1760s); opened shops in Haymarket and Piccadilly; opened a shop on the Strand (1763); also invented scientific instruments. To own a Ramsden instrument, be it one of his great thodolites or one of the many sextants and barometers produced at his London workshop, was to own not only an instrument of incrdible accuracy and great practical use, but also a thing of beauty. Ramsden ws a perfectionist, sometimes to the frustration of waiting customers, but this did not limit his productivity.</p>
