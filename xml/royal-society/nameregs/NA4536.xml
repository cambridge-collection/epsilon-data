      <p>Notes: Years of birth and death provided in Hunter's book on the early Fellows; Hunter spells his name 'Coplestone' and says that he never featured in PL or the accounts. According to BR he did not sign the Charter Book and was never admitted. Foster has a John Coplestone, who matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford (1640); perhaps Rector of Chagford, Devon, Provost of Eton (1681-1689) and Chancellor of Exeter (1675), son of Thomas Coplestone of Upton Pynes, Devon - ? the same person.</p>
