      <p>Notes: Source of birth place is DSB. What was Freiberg in Moravia is given as 'now Pribor, Czechoslovakia'; but cannot find such a place in atlas. Perhaps name has changed again since becoming either Czech Republic or Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Council Minutes 16 June 1938 item 19 record that 'Authority was given for the Charter Book to be taken to the house of Dr Sigmund Freud (Foreign Member) in order that his signature be made therein'.</p>
