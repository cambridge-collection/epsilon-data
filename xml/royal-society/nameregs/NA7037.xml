      <p>Notes: The election date is Hammond's re-election date into the Society after the grant of the second charter in April 1663. All Fellows admitted in a two-month window after this charter, until 22 June 1663, are considered Original Fellows. He was previously proposed on 23 January 1661 and mentioned as a member on 19 June 1661.</p>
      <p>He was last in the 1681 list. Speculative year of birth also provided by Hunter is 1614. Alternatively, he may have been the William Hammond who was educated abroad as a physician (born 1635), but in view of the RS connections this seems less likely - unless they're the same person (NB DNB suggests barrister and poet could be two different people but they have the same father)</p>
