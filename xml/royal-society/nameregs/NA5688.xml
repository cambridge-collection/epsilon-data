      <p>More was first elected on 17 September 1661, prior to the Society receiving its second Royal Charter, and was not officially re-elected FRS of the incorporated Royal Society until the date stated above (25 May 1664). More is therefore not considered an original Fellow of the Royal Society, a classification reserved for those named in the 1663 charter or elected within the subsequent two months, the period allowed in the charter for the declaration of Fellows. Elections like More's that predated this were no longer recognised. The date of any subsequent re-election is given in this database as the official election date.</p>
