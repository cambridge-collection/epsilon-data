      <p>Notes: His third middle name is given as Friso in BR, and this has been adopted above. However in index to BR, this name is written as Frisco, presumably a mistaken reading of BR since no other sources are mentioned. This Fellow signed a Royal page of the Charter Book and has therefore been described as a Royal Fellow.</p>
