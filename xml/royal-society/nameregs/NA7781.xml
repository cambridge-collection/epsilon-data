      <p>Notes: He was proposed at a Council meeting by Frederick Slare which may have been on 1 November 1699 (a date when the Society met) or 1 November 1700 or 1 November 1701 (when the Society did not meet, though Council may have done) and, according to Hunter admitted 30 Nov 1699. There was no meeting on 30 November 1699 or on 1 December 1701, when Thomson says he was elected. Most probably, he was proposed 1 November 1699 and elected at the next anniversary meeting 29 November 1699, but there is no written evidence for this. He signed the Charter Book at the bottom of p11</p>
