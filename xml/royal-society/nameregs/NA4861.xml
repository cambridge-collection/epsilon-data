      <p>Career: In 1894 he used Fourier's equations to divide the surface of the planet into small squares and assessed the capacity of each segment to absorb and reflect solar radiation. From this he produced a series of temperature predictions for different latitudes and seasons determined by atmospheric concentrations of Carbon Dioxide that varied from two thirds to three times the then current value. Remarkably, his calculation that a doubling of Carbon Dioxide levels would cause a warming of 5 to 6 degrees Centigrade almost exactly mirrors the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's assessment which puts 5.8 degrees Centigrade at the top of its likely warming range. A polymath interested in everything from immunology to electrical engineering, he was an early investigator of the Northern Lights. After World War I took up political causes, campaigning for immunisation against small-pox.</p>
