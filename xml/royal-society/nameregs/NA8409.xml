      <p>Notes: Mather was proposed by Richard Waller 23/7/1713 and approved by Council 27/7/1713, and appears to have been informed that he had been elected. In 1723 he wrote to ask if he was indeed a Fellow, as his name was not on the printed list. It was then discovered that he had not in fact been elected in 1713 and the matter was hastily put right (See LBC.15.75 informing Mather of his election, and a letter from Mather acknowledging this letter at MM.1.18)</p>
