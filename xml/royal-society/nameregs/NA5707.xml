      <p>Notes: Hunter gives birth date as 1641. The DSB entry for John Mayow has quite widely differing dates and places, which have not been entered above. They are as follows: b. Bray, near Looe, Dec 1641; d. London, Sep 1679. It may be that there has been some confusion between Bray in Berkshire and a Bray, near Looe, in Cornwall.</p>
