      <p>Career: Prior to WW1 worked on potential effects of the release of atomic energy, working with Ernest Rutherford at McGill in 1901 and publishing 8 papers setting out the "Disintegration Theory of Atomic Tranmustation" for which Rutherford received the Nobel Prize; Glasgow University (1904-1914) studied the displacements in the periodic table through radioactive changes leading to his theory of chemically identical elements with different atomic weights, which he called isotopes receiving the Nobel Prize in 1921; involved in the Le Play Society; established the Frederick Soddy Trust by his will, giving grants to groups studying the whole life of a community</p>
